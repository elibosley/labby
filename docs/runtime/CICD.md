# CI/CD

Last updated: 2026-08-05

This document is the authoritative contract for CI, release, and artifact delivery in `lab`. All pipeline implementations must conform to this spec.

## CI Path Routing

`ci.yml` starts with a `changes` job that runs `scripts/ci/changed_paths.py`.
That classifier maps the changed file list into stable routing categories:
`all`, `docs`, `docs_check`, `workflow`, `rust_compile`, `rust_test`, `web`,
`palette`, `npm`, `docker`, `security`, `release`, and `unraid`. Scheduled and
manual runs enable every category so periodic/manual validation stays broad.

On pull requests the `changes` job runs the classifier from the pull request's
**base commit** rather than the branch's own copy. Be precise about what that
buys. GitHub runs the workflow file itself from the merge ref, so on a
same-repo pull request the gate expressions, this job's `outputs:` block, and
the tests that police them are all branch-controlled. Pinning the classifier
stops a branch from *accidentally* rerouting its own CI while editing path
rules; it is not a control against a branch that sets out to. The controls for
that are branch protection and review on `.github/**` and `scripts/ci/**`.

Moving `changes` into a pinned reusable workflow (the `fleet-policy` pattern
above) would put the classifier *and* its `outputs:` block on a trusted ref.
It would not remove the reconciliation below: the `if:` gates still come from
the caller's merge-ref `ci.yml`, so a caller gating on a key the pinned version
does not export lands in exactly the same window, just versioned by the pin
instead of by the base branch.

That window: `ci.yml` always comes from the merge ref, so a pull request that
adds a routing key gates on a key the trusted classifier cannot emit, and every
already-open pull request against an older base hits it too.

That window must fail **open**. An unknown output evaluates to the empty
string, and `'' == 'true'` is false — so without reconciliation the gated job
skips, and `ci-gate` accepts the skip as intentional. The `classify` step
therefore reconciles what the classifier emitted against two key sets it reads
back out of `ci.yml`:

- `needs.changes.outputs.<key>` — what other jobs gate on.
- `steps.classify.outputs.<key>` — what the `changes` job forwards as a job
  output.

A gated key the trusted classifier did not emit — or emitted with a value other
than `true`/`false`, which fails `== 'true'` just as an absent key does — is
forced to `true`, so the job runs. Those keys are annotated as warnings and
exported as the `gate_key_drift` output, which `ci-gate` reports. Drift clears
on its own once the base branch carries the new key.

Everything else in that step fails **closed**, because it cannot be repaired by
running more jobs:

- A gate with no matching `steps.classify.outputs.<key>` forward reads as the
  empty string no matter what the classifier emits. That is an authoring bug,
  so the step fails the build and names the key.
- If key enumeration itself fails — `ci.yml` unreadable, moved, or no longer
  matching the expression form — the step fails rather than quietly
  reconciling nothing and reporting an all-clear.
- `ci-gate` turns drift into an **error** on non-`pull_request` events, where
  the classifier comes from the same commit as `ci.yml`: there, drift means the
  two genuinely disagree.

Three rules keep this contract honest:

- Never gate a job on a key that is not declared in the `changes` job's
  `outputs:` block, and keep each declaration forwarding the identically-named
  classify output (`unraid: ${{ steps.classify.outputs.unraid }}`). A typo on
  either side reads as the empty string.
  `crates/labby/tests/ci_changed_paths.rs` and the classify step itself both
  fail the build on that mistake.
- Every declared `changes` output must be emitted by `changed_paths.py`, except
  the runtime-only `gate_key_drift`.
- `ci-gate` requires `changes` to conclude `success`. A skipped or cancelled
  `changes` job leaves every gate expression empty, which would skip every
  gated job and turn the whole run vacuously green.

Pinning the classifier also pins its path → category **mappings**, which lag
the same way key names do: a branch that routes a new directory into an
existing category gets a well-formed `false` from the base commit's classifier,
and the gated job skips for real — no empty string, nothing for the drift
reconciliation to notice. The classify step therefore re-runs the branch's own
`scripts/ci/changed_paths.py` over the **trusted changed-file list** and unions
the result: a `false` the branch raises to `true` is taken, and nothing else is.
A value it lowers, a key it invents, and the changed-file list itself are all
ignored, so a branch can broaden its own CI but never narrow it. Broadened keys
are annotated on the run. If the branch classifier cannot run, routing degrades
to the trusted classifier alone with a warning rather than failing.

`scripts/ci/changed_paths.py` is the only place the routing key list lives. The
fallback classifier used when the base commit predates that script emits no
keys at all and lets reconciliation force every gated key to `true`, so it is
not a second copy of the list.

Branch protection should require the stable aggregate `ci-gate` check. The
heavy jobs below may be skipped when their category is false; `ci-gate` treats
`success` and intentionally `skipped` jobs as acceptable, and fails on failed or
cancelled dependencies. Native Windows workspace and Palette jobs are advisory:
they stay visible on pull requests and main but do not block `ci-gate`.

## CI Checks

Every push and pull request must pass `ci-gate`, which covers the following
jobs when their changed-path category is enabled:

| Check | Category | Command |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Unraid plugin checksums | `unraid` | `scripts/ci/unraid-plugin-checksums.sh` — fails if `unraid/labby.plg`'s companion-file `<MD5>` entities drift from `unraid/source/`. The `--tag`/`--tarball` form (checking `labbyVersion` and the release-tarball `<MD5>`) is a manual tool run when deliberately re-pointing `labbyVersion` at a new release — not a CI gate, since a freshly-built tarball's MD5 isn't reproducible run-to-run |
| Workflow lint | `workflow` | `actionlint` over `.github/workflows/` |
| Frontend build | `rust_compile`, `docs_check`, `web`, `docker`, or `release` | `./.github/actions/build-gateway-admin` (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build` in `apps/gateway-admin`) |
| Gateway Admin browser tests | `web` | frozen install, pinned Playwright Chromium provisioning, and `pnpm test:browser`; explicitly aggregated by `ci-gate` |
| Compile | `rust_compile` | `cargo check --workspace --all-features` |
| MSRV | `rust_compile` | `cargo +1.97.1 check --workspace --all-features --all-targets --locked` |
| Feature slices | `rust_compile` | `cargo check -p labby --no-default-features --features <slice>` |
| Extracted crate slices | `rust_compile` | crate-specific `cargo check` commands for extracted runtime crates |
| Generated docs freshness | `docs_check` | `just docs-check` |
| Format | `rust_compile` | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` |
| Lint | `rust_compile` | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings` |
| Deny | `security` | `cargo deny check` |
| Palette renderer | `palette` | frozen install, lint, Vitest coverage, typecheck, and Vite build |
| Palette Tauri | `palette` | independent lockfile audit plus required Linux tests and an advisory native Windows build/test smoke |
| Rust coverage | `rust_test` | LCOV trend artifact with project and critical auth/gateway/dispatch/config floors |
| Tests (Linux) | `rust_test` | `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features --profile ci` on the Rust runner-farm pool |
| Tests (Linux fork PR fallback) | `rust_test` | same nextest run on the Rust runner-farm pool without repository secrets |
| Tests (Windows, advisory) | `rust_test` | same nextest run on GitHub-hosted `windows-latest`, including fork PRs; cached and visible but excluded from `ci-gate` |
| MCP conformance | `rust_test` or `workflow` | Labby's pinned rmcp `3.1.0` authenticated smoke plus the pinned rmcp `3.1.0` fixture's dated `2026-07-28` server/client suites, with separate strict dated and extension baselines |
| MCP upstream drift | weekly/manual separate workflow | compares pinned MCP spec and rmcp commits, maps upstream changes to Labby code and required tests, and opens or updates one actionable issue |
| Release metadata contract | `release` | version and Rust toolchain lockstep only; release builds do not run in PR CI |
| Container source contract | `docker` | validates the Dockerfile and required source inputs without building an image |

Clippy runs with `-D warnings` — zero warnings are permitted. This is enforced at the workspace lint layer.

The frontend build is required because the Rust binary embeds the exported
Labby assets. It is a production build gate, not a TypeScript strictness gate:
`apps/gateway-admin/next.config.mjs` currently sets
`typescript.ignoreBuildErrors = true`. Run `pnpm test` in
`apps/gateway-admin` for the frontend unit and install-script test contract.

MCP conformance details, exact reproducibility pins, and the strict extension
gap baseline are documented in
[MCP_CONFORMANCE.md](../surfaces/MCP_CONFORMANCE.md).

The advisory `MCP upstream drift` workflow watches both the MCP specification
repository and the latest rmcp release. Its pinned inputs live in
`conformance/upstream-baseline.json`; `scripts/ci/mcp_upstream_drift.py`
translates upstream file/release changes into the Labby modules and validation
commands that must be reviewed. It updates a stable issue rather than creating
notification spam. Never advance the baseline merely to silence the issue:
land the required code/tests and the baseline update together.

## CI Platform

- **Provider:** GitHub Actions
- **Manual runs:** `CI` supports `workflow_dispatch`
- **Scheduled runs:** `CI` runs weekly on Monday at 09:23 UTC to keep
  dependency/advisory visibility fresh even when no PR is active
- **Job split:**
  - `changes` classifies paths first and exports category booleans, forcing any gated key the trusted base-branch classifier cannot emit to `true`
  - Frontend assets build once when required, then Rust compile/lint/test jobs download the exported `apps/gateway-admin/out` artifact
  - Required fast jobs run only when their category is enabled; `ci-gate` is the stable required check for branch protection
  - Native Windows workspace and Palette jobs use GitHub-hosted runners, bounded timeouts, and keyed Cargo caches; they report portability regressions without blocking `ci-gate`
  - Heavy release work starts only from a published stable GitHub release
  - Release Linux jobs use GitHub-hosted x86_64 runners; native Windows artifacts use GitHub-hosted Windows

## Linux runner farm

All fast Linux jobs run on the self-hosted farm. Rust jobs select
`ci-pool-rust`, Node and browser jobs select `ci-pool-typescript`, and
policy/metadata jobs select `ci-pool-ops`. Rust jobs use the repository
`setup-rust-kache` composite, which connects trusted jobs to the shared MinIO
cache and runs bare Cargo when credentials are unavailable. Runner setup is
documented in [Actions runner setup](./ACTIONS_RUNNER.md).

## Build Matrix

| Platform | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Linux x86_64 | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Windows x86_64 | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |

Windows is a supported platform. Official Windows release artifacts are built
on native GitHub-hosted Windows runners using the MSVC target. Linux-to-Windows
GNU cross-compilation may be useful experimentally, but it is not the release
support contract.

## Integration Tests

Live service integration tests are **excluded from CI**. They require real service instances and are run locally only.

```bash
# Local only — never runs in CI
just test-integration
```

Integration tests must be marked `#[ignore]` so `cargo nextest run` skips them without explicit opt-in.

## Release Process

1. Release Please prepares the version/changelog PR.
2. Merging that PR creates the stable `vX.Y.Z` tag plus a draft GitHub release.
3. Publishing the stable release triggers all heavy release workflows.
4. Preflight requires strict stable SemVer, ancestry from `origin/main`, and exact Cargo/npm/MCP/release-manifest version lockstep.
5. Binary, Incus, and container candidates are built and smoke-tested on GitHub-hosted x86_64 runners.
6. The final gated job verifies checksums, emits an SPDX SBOM and GitHub provenance attestations, uploads assets to the published release, then publishes the exact tested image by digest and signs it keylessly with Cosign.
7. The immutable image tag and compatibility `latest` tag advance together; failure deletes a newly-created image version and restores the previous `latest` digest. The published GitHub release itself is never deleted by automation.

The npm and MCP registries do not support deleting an already-published
version. If publication reaches one registry and then fails, rerun the same tag
after correcting the failure: the release job checks each registry first,
skips the version that already exists, republishes only the missing surface,
and leaves the already-published GitHub release in place. Never create a replacement tag or bump the version to recover a
partially published release.

**Tag format:** `vX.Y.Z` — no other formats are accepted.

**Version policy:** single version across the entire workspace. `lab` and `lab-apis` always share the same version number.

## Artifact Distribution

- **Surface:** GitHub Releases
- **Container surface:** GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/dinglebear-ai/labby`)
- **Artifacts per release:** one binary archive per supported target (Linux x86_64 and Windows x86_64)
- **Checksums:** every binary archive has a SHA-256 checksum file
- **Package registries:** the `@dinglebear/labby` npm launcher and `server.json` MCP Registry metadata publish from the same validated version.

## MCP Registry DNS Key Rotation

The release workflow verifies `mcp-publisher` against the exact v1.8.0 GitHub
release asset SHA-256 before the `MCP_PRIVATE_KEY` secret enters the process.
Key rotation is a coordinated DNS and GitHub operation; never change only one
side or print the private key in a workflow log.

1. On a trusted host with OpenSSL 3, generate a fresh Ed25519 key:
   `openssl genpkey -algorithm Ed25519 -out key.pem`.
2. Derive the public value with
   `openssl pkey -in key.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 32 | base64`.
3. Replace the TXT record at the **`dinglebear.ai` apex** with exactly one
   `v=MCPv1; k=ed25519; p=<public-key>` value. The registry does not use an
   `_mcp-*` selector, and the old record must be removed rather than retained.
4. After authoritative and public DNS both return only the new record, derive
   the private hex value with
   `openssl pkey -in key.pem -noout -text | grep -A3 'priv:' | tail -n +2 | tr -d ' :\n'`.
5. Replace the repository `MCP_PRIVATE_KEY` Actions secret using a no-echo
   channel, run `mcp-publisher login dns --domain dinglebear.ai --private-key "$MCP_PRIVATE_KEY"`, and verify an idempotent metadata publication.
6. Securely destroy the local plaintext key after the secret and DNS record
   have been verified; if any step fails, restore both prior DNS and secret
   together.

## Test Reports

CI uses the `ci` nextest profile in `.config/nextest.toml`. The test job
uploads `target/nextest/ci/junit.xml` as the `nextest-junit` artifact with
short retention so failed runs can be inspected without scraping logs.

## Cargo Deny Advisories

`deny.toml` keeps unmaintained advisory checks enabled. Any ignored advisory
must include a dependency-path comment and should be removed once the upstream
dependency path is gone. The weekly scheduled CI run keeps those exceptions
visible even if no pull request touches dependency policy.

## Size Policy

Binary size is tracked but not hard-gated in CI unless repo tooling enforces a monolith size limit. If a size gate is added, it runs in the fast check job.

## Frontend Tests

The shared `build-gateway-admin` action installs dependencies, verifies the
synced installer, runs `pnpm run test:unit`, runs `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`, and
then runs `pnpm build`. This is the CI gate for the embedded gateway-admin
assets that are compiled into the `lab` binary. Keep TypeScript explicit here:
`next.config.mjs` intentionally ignores build-time TypeScript errors so asset
builds are not the type-safety boundary.

```bash
cd apps/gateway-admin
pnpm run test:unit
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm test
pnpm test:acp
pnpm test:browser
```

## Non-Goals

- no telemetry pipeline
- no background analytics
- no phone-home behavior in any CI or release step
