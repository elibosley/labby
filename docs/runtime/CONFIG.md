# Runtime Configuration

Labby separates non-secret preferences from secrets and endpoint credentials.

## Files And Precedence

Configuration lookup stops at the first existing TOML file:

1. `./config.toml`
2. `$LABBY_HOME/config.toml`, when `LABBY_HOME` is set
3. `~/.labby/config.toml`
4. `~/.config/labby/config.toml`

`LABBY_HOME` must be an absolute path. When set, it replaces the two user-home
candidates rather than adding another fallback. The access-control store is
always `$LABBY_HOME/access.db`; without an override it is
`~/.labby/access.db`. Relative state roots fail closed. Keep the database and
its `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars together under a service-owned directory; there is
no separate access-database path override.

Runtime precedence is:

1. CLI flags
2. Environment variables, including `~/.labby/.env`
3. `config.toml`
4. Built-in defaults

Existing process values win over dotenv files. Labby then loads
`$LABBY_HOME/.env` (normally `~/.labby/.env`) and finally a current-directory
`.env` for names that remain unset. Proxy CLI overrides are applied after the
TOML model loads.

Keep secrets, tokens, passwords, OAuth client secrets, and upstream credential
values in `~/.labby/.env`. Keep product preferences in TOML. The annotated
example in [../../config/config.example.toml](../../config/config.example.toml)
is the canonical hand-written configuration sample. Generated environment
metadata lives in [../generated/env-reference.md](../generated/env-reference.md).
The code-owned proxy key inventory lives in
[../generated/proxy-config-reference.md](../generated/proxy-config-reference.md).

## Supported Sections

- `[output]`: CLI rendering defaults.
- `[log]` and `[local_logs]`: tracing and local server-log storage.
- `[mcp]`: default transport (`stdio`, `http`, or `unix_socket`), HTTP/TCP bind
  host/port, Unix-socket path/mode/ownership and optional Linux peer-credential
  allowlists, and allowed hosts.
- `[proxy]`: foreground direct stdio-proxy exposure, auth, endpoint path,
  external port selection, bearer secret key name, OAuth scopes, explicit
  child-environment inheritance, and shutdown preference.
- `[api]`: CORS preferences and the explicit trusted-forwarded-authority opt-in.
- `[web]`: exported asset location and development-only auth bypass.
- `[workspace]`: root for the optional filesystem browser. Default:
  `~/.labby/workspace`.
- `[gateway]`: upstream recovery, stdio spawn guard, and extra allowed commands.
- `[code_mode]`: sandbox execution and result-envelope limits.
- `[[openapi.specs]]`: allowlisted local Code Mode OpenAPI providers.
- `[oauth]`: callback relay targets.
- `[auth]`: bearer/OAuth mode and auth-store preferences.
- `[admin]`: runtime opt-in for `lab_admin`.
- `[setup]`: provisioning preferences.
- `[services]`: supported per-service preference overrides.
- `[[upstream]]`: proxied MCP upstreams.
- `[[protected_mcp_routes]]`: route-scoped OAuth resource servers.
- `[[virtual_servers]]`: virtual servers backed by registered Labby services.
- `[public_urls]`: canonical external URLs.

Top-level gateway timeouts, import mode, tombstones, pending imports, and
quarantined virtual servers are serialized alongside those sections.

### Trusted forwarded authority

Protected-route selection uses the request's `Host` header by default and
ignores `X-Forwarded-Host`. A deployment whose reverse proxy cannot preserve
the public `Host` may set:

```toml
[api]
trust_forwarded_headers = true
```

This setting makes `X-Forwarded-Host` authoritative for protected-route and
route-metadata selection; it does not change client-IP attribution or trust
`X-Forwarded-Proto`. Enable it only when direct access to Labby's listener is
blocked and every trusted proxy overwrites, rather than appends or preserves,
the inbound `X-Forwarded-Host` value. Otherwise a client can choose the virtual
protected resource by supplying that header. Prefer preserving the original
`Host` and leaving this setting at its secure default of `false`.

Gateway-subset protected routes may set `target.project_id` to bind the route
to one access-control Project. The value is opaque authorization context, not a
display name. CLI updates preserve an existing binding when `--project-id` is
omitted and remove it only when `--clear-project-id` is explicit.

## Gateway Upstreams

An upstream is HTTP, stdio, or a Unix-domain socket. HTTP credentials reference
environment variable names; secret values never belong in TOML. Stdio commands
pass through the spawn guard unless the operator explicitly extends or disables
it. A Unix-socket upstream requires `transport = "unix_socket"`, a `socket_path`
(absolute, or a Linux abstract `@name`), and an HTTP(S) `url` supplying the
request path and `Host` authority; a custom `Authorization` header is rejected so
credentials stay in `bearer_token_env` or `[upstream.oauth]`.

Use `labby gateway add`, `update`, `remove`, `reload`, and related
commands rather than editing active gateway state concurrently by hand.

To recover disconnected upstream MCP servers automatically, enable the
long-lived reconnect cycle:

```toml
[gateway]
auto_reconnect = true
```

Labby probes each enabled non-OAuth upstream every 30 seconds, backs off after
failures, and replaces stale stdio or HTTP transports when they recover. The
default is `false`; ephemeral connection tests never start recovery tasks.

### Upstream OAuth (authorization_code + PKCE)

OAuth upstreams use the encrypted credential store and the shared gateway
subject. The upstream remains an HTTP MCP endpoint; Labby's stdio mode is the
downstream transport to the MCP client.

```toml
[[upstream]]
name = "example"
transport = "http"
url = "https://mcp.example.com/mcp"

[upstream.oauth]
mode = "authorization_code_pkce"

[upstream.oauth.registration]
strategy = "dynamic"
```

For `labby mcp`, configure `LABBY_OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `~/.labby/.env`.
The first request that needs the upstream opens the browser and completes the
provider callback on a listener bound only to `127.0.0.1`. Set
`LABBY_STDIO_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT` only when the provider requires a fixed
loopback port; `0` (the default) uses an ephemeral port. Do not put OAuth
tokens, authorization codes, or client secrets in TOML.

## Direct Stdio Proxy

`labby setup proxy` writes all ten non-secret `[proxy]` keys to
`$LABBY_HOME/config.toml`. Bearer material is stored separately in
`$LABBY_HOME/.env` under the configured `proxy.bearer_token_env` key. The
default key is `LABBY_PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN`; it is separate from the daemon
administrator token.

There are no implicit `LABBY_PROXY_EXPOSURE`, `LABBY_PROXY_AUTH`, path, port,
range, scopes, inheritance, or shutdown environment aliases. Those preferences
come from one-run CLI options where offered, then TOML, then defaults. Proxy
environment controls and the complete table are documented in the
[stdio MCP proxy guide](../guides/STDIO_MCP_PROXY.md).

## Authentication

`LABBY_AUTH_MODE` selects bearer or OAuth behavior. OAuth deployments also
require a canonical public URL, Google OIDC credentials, the bootstrap admin
identity, and the configured signing/encryption material described in
[OAUTH.md](./OAUTH.md) and the generated environment reference.

The web-auth bypass is development-only. Do not enable it on a publicly reachable
host or use it as a substitute for reverse-proxy authentication.

## Removed Configuration

Current Labby does not accept MCP Registry browser settings, ACP providers or
sessions, Marketplace sources, Fleet/node roles, Deploy-product policies, or
Stash workspace configuration. Historical schemas are preserved under
[../archive/retired-labby](../archive/retired-labby/) and must not be
reintroduced as compatibility aliases.
