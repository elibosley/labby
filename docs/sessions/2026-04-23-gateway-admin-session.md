## User Request

Perform a thorough mobile-optimization polishing pass starting with `/gateways`, with these goals:

- condense the four mobile summary cards into a much smaller strip
- place search directly beneath that strip
- hide non-search filters by default
- make the gateways table as dense as possible while keeping it glanceable and readable
- later, carry related density and control refinements into the individual gateway detail view
- finally, wire the work into the real local workflow rather than relying on the mock-only review path

## Session Overview

- Reworked the real `gateway-admin` `/gateways` mobile list page to use a compact summary strip, integrated search/filter affordance, denser rows, inline counts, tighter table radius, and token-backed alternating row tones.
- Reworked the real individual gateway detail page to move manage/warning controls under search, improve transport iconography, restyle command surfaces, and theme the tools-list scrollbar.
- Added a development-only `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_AUTH_BYPASS=true` frontend mode that synthesizes an authenticated browser session for local real-backend work without changing production auth behavior.
- Added paired local workflow commands in `Justfile`: `just gateway-admin-local` and `just gateway-admin-ui-local`.
- Wrote design and plan documents for the local auth-mode wiring pass.

## Sequence of Events

1. The session started as a brainstorming/design pass for `/gateways` mobile density. The user clarified that mobile should default to `Gateways`, keep `Discovered Tools` less prominent, and collapse the top summary area into a compact strip.
2. A first browser-based mock/review loop was done for `/gateways`, iterating on denser mobile layout, icon-only summary chips, search-integrated filters, and reduced row spacing.
3. The `/gateways` mobile list page was implemented in the real app components: summary strip, integrated search/filter control, inline metrics, and denser mobile row layout.
4. A mobile interaction bug in the gateway form dialog was fixed after the user reported that `ENV` and `JSON` were not working on mobile. The root cause was mobile drawer positioning leaving panels offscreen.
5. A local auth-bypassed review surface was created for `apps/gateway-admin` using `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_DATA=true` and a Next dev server on port `3101`, then inspected in Chrome DevTools with a phone viewport.
6. A DevTools-driven tightening pass was applied to the `/gateways` page: shorter placeholders, smaller mobile controls, tighter row padding, narrower state column, and reduced table/action sizing.
7. The table shell radius was changed to stop inheriting the broader `AURORA_STRONG_PANEL` rounding, and token-backed alternating row striping was added. The first striping attempt used raw `rgba(...)` values; that was corrected by introducing token-backed CSS utilities and documenting the dense-table striping rule in the design-system contract.
8. The user then shifted focus to the individual gateway detail page, asking for `Manage Tools` to become icon-only, to move under the search bar next to the warning icon, for a better `stdio` icon, and for command treatments to feel denser and better themed.
9. The detail page was updated so the inventory toolbar under search owns the icon-only manage control and warning control, the tools table suppresses the duplicate manage toggle, the `stdio` badge uses a stronger terminal icon, and the top command block uses mono text with an inset Aurora surface.
10. A hook-order error was introduced while making the detail page tabs controlled (`Rendered fewer hooks than expected`). That was fixed by moving derived `useMemo` values above the loading/error return gates.
11. The user then clarified that the command styling request also applied to the inline command/endpoint under each gateway in the table view. Those inline strips were restyled with mono text and inset Aurora surfaces, while hiding horizontal scrollbar chrome there.
12. The themed scrollbar requirement was then applied to the tools list inside an individual gateway detail view by adding `aurora-scrollbar` to the scroll container in `tool-exposure-table.tsx`.
13. The user asked to "wire this up for real for real." A second design/plan pass was done for local auth/runtime modes, followed by implementation of a development-only `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_AUTH_BYPASS` flow, settings visibility, and updated local workflow docs.
14. Finally, paired `just` commands were added so local real-backend usage is a documented, repeatable workflow rather than manual environment setup.

## Key Findings

- The real `/gateways` mobile list-page changes live in the actual production components, not just the mock review surface: `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-list-content.tsx:557`, `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-list-content.tsx:628`, `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-filters.tsx:236`, `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-table.tsx:288`.
- The table shell no longer relies on the shared strong-panel radius recipe; row striping is now token-backed through CSS utilities instead of raw color literals: `apps/gateway-admin/app/globals.css:307`, `apps/gateway-admin/app/globals.css:318`, `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-table.tsx:67`.
- The inline command/endpoint under each gateway row is now rendered as a mono inset strip with hidden scrollbar chrome rather than plain muted text: `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-table.tsx:324`, `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-table.tsx:531`, `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-table.tsx:541`.
- The gateway detail page now owns the icon-only manage toggle and warning affordance in the toolbar beneath search; the tools table can suppress its duplicate manage button: `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-detail-content.tsx:732`, `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-detail-content.tsx:789`, `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/tool-exposure-table.tsx:60`, `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/tool-exposure-table.tsx:275`.
- The `stdio` transport badge now uses `SquareTerminal` instead of the weaker previous icon: `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/transport-badge.tsx:1`, `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/transport-badge.tsx:26`.
- Local real-backend work no longer requires mock mode; the frontend can synthesize a stable authenticated session in development-only local bypass mode: `apps/gateway-admin/lib/auth/auth-mode.ts:15`, `apps/gateway-admin/lib/auth/session-store.ts:44`, `apps/gateway-admin/lib/auth/session-store.ts:103`, `apps/gateway-admin/lib/auth/session-store.ts:144`.
- The Settings page reports that local mode distinctly as `Local dev bypass` instead of misclassifying it as hosted browser-session auth: `apps/gateway-admin/lib/dashboard/admin-insights.ts:119`, `apps/gateway-admin/lib/dashboard/admin-insights.ts:207`, `apps/gateway-admin/app/(admin)/settings/page.tsx:25`.
- The local workflow is now codified in `Justfile` rather than relying on manual shell export sequences: `Justfile:49`, `Justfile:57`.

## Technical Decisions

- Used the existing `gateway-admin` production components for the mobile list/detail work instead of maintaining a separate mock-only implementation. This keeps the review surface and shipped code aligned.
- Chose a dedicated table-shell recipe for `/gateways` instead of overriding `AURORA_STRONG_PANEL` radius with a hardcoded utility. That keeps the shared token recipe intact while allowing a tighter table-specific shape.
- Rejected raw `rgba(...)` row striping in product code and replaced it with token-backed CSS utilities in `globals.css` so striping stays inside the Aurora contract.
- Used icon-only controls where the user requested density (`Manage Tools`, warning shortcut, `stdio` transport treatment), but kept accessible `aria-label`/`title` affordances.
- Kept the gateway-row inline command horizontally scrollable but hid scrollbar chrome so dense mobile rows do not visually advertise a full scroll surface.
- Themed the actual scrollable tools list with the existing `aurora-scrollbar` utility rather than inventing another scrollbar variant.
- Implemented local auth bypass in the frontend auth/session layer instead of adding a new Rust CLI mode. The backend pairing remains `LAB_WEB_UI_DISABLE_AUTH=true`; the frontend now has a clear local mode that still satisfies UI consumers expecting `session.user`.
- Added `just` commands rather than a new Rust subcommand because the requested workflow is development orchestration, not shipped product functionality.

## Errors Encountered

- Mobile `ENV` / `JSON` controls in the gateway form dialog did not work. Root cause: mobile drawers were switched to `fixed inset-0` but retained offscreen `left: 100%` behavior. Resolution: remove the mobile offscreen positioning and keep desktop side-drawer behavior responsive-only.
- The first table-row striping attempt used hardcoded `rgba(...)` values. Root cause: quick visual tweak violated the Aurora token contract. Resolution: replaced with token-backed `.gateway-row-tone-a` / `.gateway-row-tone-b` utilities and updated the design-system contract.
- The local `:3101` Next server became unreachable during one restart attempt. Root cause: another detached Next dev server was already running and forcing inconsistent startup behavior. Resolution: identify the stale process, kill it, and restart cleanly on `0.0.0.0:3101`.
- A detail-page React runtime error appeared: `Rendered fewer hooks than expected.` Root cause: controlled-tab work made hook ordering visible because derived `useMemo` hooks were still below loading/error returns. Resolution: move the derived hook calls above the return gates.
- Chrome DevTools initially hit hosted auth instead of the real UI. Root cause: no session in that browser context. Resolution: use the local auth-bypassed review surface for interactive mobile inspection.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

- Before: `/gateways` mobile used four larger summary cards and a more vertically expensive control layout.
  After: it uses a compact summary strip, search directly beneath it, and filters hidden behind an integrated affordance.
- Before: gateway rows stacked information more loosely and used separate columns/cards for counts.
  After: tools/resources/prompts/runtime are inline and the row footprint is tighter.
- Before: the table shell inherited broader card rounding.
  After: it uses a tighter table-specific radius closer to the search bar treatment.
- Before: row striping was absent.
  After: rows alternate using restrained Aurora-token-based tones.
- Before: inline gateway endpoint/command text was plain and less scannable.
  After: it is shown in mono on an inset Aurora surface in both list and detail views.
- Before: the detail page kept warning state in the header area and a separate `Manage Tools` text button inside the tools table controls.
  After: both controls sit beneath the search bar in the inventory toolbar, with `Manage Tools` icon-only.
- Before: local real-backend work required either hosted auth or manual environment juggling.
  After: it has a documented `real backend + local auth bypass` mode and paired `just` commands.

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: the worktree is heavily dirty with many unrelated changes. Rolling back only this session’s work requires care to avoid disturbing unrelated edits.
- Risk: the current local auth bypass intentionally fabricates a frontend session; if another page starts assuming more backend-issued session fields later, that synthetic shape may need extension.
- Rollback path: revert the session-specific frontend files listed in **Files Modified**, remove the two new `just` recipes, and remove the local auth-bypass docs/spec/plan files.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not add a new Rust CLI command for gateway-admin local workflow. Chose `Justfile` orchestration instead because this is developer workflow, not shipped runtime surface.
- Did not keep raw `rgba(...)` row striping despite the quick visual win. Replaced it with token-backed utilities to stay inside the design contract.
- Did not keep `Manage Tools` as a text button in the detail view. Converted it to icon-only to match the requested mobile density.
- Did not keep the detail-page warning affordance in the header chrome. Moved it under the search bar per the user’s requested layout.

## Open Questions

- No transcript path or environment-exposed session identifier was available during documentation, so neither `transcript` nor `session id` metadata could be populated.
- The current worktree status shows a rename in progress for the design-system contract (`docs/design-system-contract.md -> docs/design/design-system-contract.md`) as part of broader unrelated changes. The authoritative final location of that document in this branch is therefore not settled by this session alone.
- The new `just gateway-admin-local` and `just gateway-admin-ui-local` commands were added and documented, but were not executed directly in this session; the live local workflow was started with equivalent manual commands.

## Next Steps

### Unfinished work from this session

- Run the new `just gateway-admin-local` and `just gateway-admin-ui-local` commands directly to confirm they behave exactly like the manually verified environment setup.
- Do one final live visual cleanup pass on the real `/gateways` and `/gateway/?id=...` surfaces if the user identifies any remaining spacing or contrast issues.

### Follow-on tasks not yet started

- Add targeted automated tests for the new local auth-bypass mode and settings labeling.
- Add targeted tests for the detail-page toolbar changes (`Manage Tools`, warning shortcut, and `stdio` icon-only treatment).
- Normalize documentation references once the broader docs rename/move work in the branch is settled.
