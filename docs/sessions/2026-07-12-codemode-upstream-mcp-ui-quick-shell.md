# Code Mode upstream MCP UI and quick-shell verification

## User Request

The user asked whether Code Mode's own MCP UI resource and an upstream tool's MCP UI resource would both show when the upstream tool is invoked through Code Mode. They then asked to test quick-shell through Labby and show the actual quick-shell app, not a local mock.

## Session Overview

Code Mode was changed to keep its own top-level MCP UI while also surfacing upstream per-tool MCP UI resources inside the Code Mode call inspector. The local CLI path successfully invoked the real quick-shell upstream tool and created a quick-shell session, but the in-chat Labby app connector could not render the real quick-shell UI because it returned `UNAUTHORIZED` with `oauth_refresh_token_missing`.

## Sequence of Events

1. Investigated the Code Mode trace and MCP call path to see whether upstream `_meta.ui.resourceUri` was preserved or shadowed by Code Mode's own UI.
2. Added per-call UI capture through the Code Mode runner, trace serialization, gateway host, and frontend inspector.
3. Added a tool-metadata fallback for upstream tools that advertise UI in tool metadata but do not return UI in the call result.
4. Refreshed upstream resource caches for healthy UI-enabled upstreams so proxied UI resources are available when Code Mode needs to read them.
5. Verified the code paths with TypeScript and Rust tests, plus a quick-shell gateway smoke.
6. Attempted to show the real quick-shell app in chat; an initial screenshot used synthetic iframe content, then a real quick-shell CLI call succeeded, while the in-chat Labby app connector failed auth.
7. Closed the implementation bead and created a follow-up bead for the blocked real in-chat quick-shell UI rendering proof after Labby app reauth.

## Key Findings

- `crates/labby-gateway/src/gateway/code_mode/code_mode_host.rs:538` extracts UI from call results, and `:547` extracts fallback UI from upstream tool metadata.
- `crates/labby-codemode/src/types.rs:341` now models executed calls with per-call UI, and `:356` serializes the optional UI link on each call.
- `apps/gateway-admin/components/code-mode-app/code-mode-inspector.tsx:593` renders the per-call MCP UI preview, with the visible "MCP UI" label at `:654`.
- `crates/labby/src/mcp/assets/code_mode_app.html:599` reads `call.ui`; `:607` hydrates embedded upstream UI resources in the bundled standalone Code Mode app.
- `crates/labby-gateway/src/upstream/pool/ensure.rs:336` refreshes stale or empty UI resource cache entries for healthy upstreams with `proxy_resources=true`.
- The live quick-shell upstream was reachable through the local CLI and returned session id `0c9f788b-88f3-4888-b3f9-eff1e9db5734`, but the chat connector could not call it because OAuth reauthentication is required.

## Technical Decisions

- Code Mode remains the outer MCP UI resource; upstream MCP UI is displayed inside the Code Mode inspector at the call row level.
- Per-call `ui.resourceUri` is preferred over mirroring upstream UI to the outer Code Mode tool result, because mirroring would replace or confuse the Code Mode application itself.
- The gateway captures both result `_meta.ui` and tool-definition `_meta.ui.resourceUri` because tools like quick-shell can expose UI on the tool definition.
- Resource cache refresh is lazy and scoped to healthy UI-enabled upstreams, avoiding a broad unconditional resource fetch on every gateway operation.
- The bundled `code_mode_app.html` was patched alongside the React source because the served MCP UI asset comes from the checked-in bundle and no generator step was identified during the session.

## Beads Activity

| bead | title | action | final status | why it mattered |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lab-semog` | Surface upstream MCP UI inside Code Mode | Created, implemented against, and closed. | closed | Tracked the core bug: Labby-connected clients cannot call the upstream directly, so Code Mode must carry and render upstream MCP UI. |
| `lab-52tl3` | Validate real quick-shell MCP UI rendering after Labby app reauth | Created as a follow-up. | open | Tracks the blocked proof that the real quick-shell `ui://quick-shell/mcp-app.html` component renders in chat after connector reauth. |

## Repository Maintenance

- Plans: checked `docs/plans/complete/mcp-streamable-http-oauth-proxy.md` and `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md`. No plan was moved because the first was already complete and the fleet websocket plan was not proven complete in this session.
- Beads: `lab-semog` was closed after implementation and verification; `lab-52tl3` was created for the remaining real in-chat quick-shell UI validation.
- Worktrees and branches: inspected the main worktree and registered worktrees. The main worktree is `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab`; the `marketplace-no-mcp` worktree is intentional long-lived project state and was left alone.
- Stale docs: no general docs were updated because the session changed runtime and UI behavior still sitting in the dirty worktree. The remaining real quick-shell UI proof is captured in `lab-52tl3`.
- Transparency: the implementation files remain dirty and uncommitted. This save workflow commits only the generated session artifact.

## Tools and Skills Used

- Skill: `vibin:save-to-md` for the final session artifact, repository maintenance pass, and path-limited docs commit.
- Beads CLI: used `bd` to create, inspect, close, and follow up on session work.
- Shell and git: used `git status`, `git log`, `git worktree`, `gh pr view`, `find`, `rg`, and targeted test commands to inspect repo state and evidence.
- Rust toolchain: used `cargo fmt` and `cargo test` for the changed Rust crates.
- Node/TypeScript toolchain: used `pnpm --dir apps/gateway-admin exec tsx --test ...` for Code Mode app parser and inspector tests.
- Labby CLI and MCP paths: used `target/debug/labby gateway test`, `target/debug/labby gateway code exec`, direct JSON-RPC calls, and the in-chat Labby app connector.
- Browser tooling: used a Playwright-style screenshot flow to render the Code Mode UI; the first rendered quick-shell content was synthetic and was later called out as insufficient.
- Lumen semantic search: attempted repo semantic search, but it was degraded by HTTP 413 embedding length errors and one unsupported/typoed dispatch; exact local file reads and `rg` were used instead.

## Errors Encountered

- Lumen semantic search repeatedly failed while indexing with HTTP 413 from the embedding service, so the session pivoted to targeted `rg` and direct file reads.
- An early quick-shell CLI call returned an upstream `Transport closed` error; after a gateway test/refresh, the later Code Mode CLI invocation succeeded.
- Direct reads of guessed quick-shell UI resource URIs returned upstream resource read failures with `Transport closed`; the expected quick-shell URI still needs real in-chat validation after reauth.
- The first visual proof used synthetic quick-shell iframe content, which did not satisfy the user's request to show the actual quick-shell app.
- The real in-chat Labby app connector failed with `UNAUTHORIZED` and `oauth_refresh_token_missing`, blocking real quick-shell UI rendering in chat.
- Direct root MCP `tools/call` hit `confirmation_required` for quick-shell because the destructive upstream tool path requires confirmation.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code Mode UI ownership | Code Mode could expose its own MCP UI but did not show upstream tool MCP UI resources inside the call trace. | Code Mode remains the top-level UI and renders upstream MCP UI at the individual call row. |
| Upstream UI capture | UI links were not reliably retained for proxied tools, especially when UI was advertised on tool metadata. | Result `_meta.ui` and tool metadata `_meta.ui.resourceUri` both produce per-call UI links. |
| Trace schema | `calls[]` did not expose `ui.resourceUri`. | `calls[].ui.resourceUri` is emitted and documented in the output schema. |
| Bundled Code Mode app | The bundled standalone app did not hydrate upstream MCP UI resources. | The bundle includes an MCP UI strip and iframe hydration through `readServerResource`. |
| Resource cache | Healthy upstreams with UI tools could still have an empty proxied resource cache. | Healthy UI-enabled upstreams can refresh resource cache lazily when needed. |

| In-chat Labby app `_codemode` call | Real quick-shell app renders in chat. | Failed with `UNAUTHORIZED/oauth_refresh_token_missing`. | blocked |

## Risks and Rollback

- The implementation code is still dirty in the worktree and has not been committed by this save workflow. Rollback for the implementation is a targeted restore of the modified code files after reviewing any user-owned edits.
- The frontend bundle was manually updated; a future build process could overwrite it if the generated source pipeline differs from the checked-in asset.
- Real chat rendering depends on the Labby app connector being reauthenticated and on the upstream quick-shell resource being readable through Labby.
- This session artifact is isolated in a docs-only commit and can be reverted independently if the log itself needs correction.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not proxy or mirror upstream UI as the outer Code Mode tool result, because that would interfere with Code Mode's own MCP UI resource.
- Did not delete any worktrees or branches; the observed extra worktree is the documented long-lived `marketplace-no-mcp` branch.
- Did not claim the real quick-shell app was rendered in chat after the connector auth failure; the remaining proof was moved to `lab-52tl3`.
- Did not move `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` because this session did not prove it complete.

## Open Questions

- After Labby app reauthentication, does the real quick-shell `ui://quick-shell/mcp-app.html` component render inside Code Mode in the chat surface?
- Is there a canonical generator for `crates/labby/src/mcp/assets/code_mode_app.html` that should replace the manual bundle patch?
- Should the gateway expose a safer confirmed path for destructive upstream tools invoked from widget callbacks, or is the current confirmation boundary the intended design?

## Next Steps

1. Reauthenticate the Labby app connector in chat.
2. Call the actual quick-shell tool through the Labby app connector, not through a mock iframe or direct root MCP bypass.
3. Verify the real quick-shell MCP UI renders inside the Code Mode call inspector and close `lab-52tl3` if it does.
4. Commit the implementation changes separately after reviewing the dirty code diff and rerunning the relevant verification suite.
