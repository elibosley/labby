# Code Mode review hardening closeout

## User Request

The session began with a request to remove `.full-review/`, run `comprehensive-review: full-review` scoped only to Code Mode code, then dispatch parallel agents to address all attached high-priority Code Mode inspector issues. Later requests asked for the remaining review suggestions to be implemented, committed, pushed, PR'd, reviewed with `lavra:lavra-review`, merged into `main`, and finally captured with `vibin:save-to-md`.

## Session Overview

The Code Mode review-hardening branch was merged through PR 221, and live GitHub checks confirmed the post-merge CI, Incus image build, and release-please workflow succeeded. The Labby MCP Tailscale endpoint was also verified as `http://100.99.0.1:40100/mcp`.

For this save pass, I used a clean session-log branch from `origin/main` because the canonical worktree at `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab` is currently on `codex/land-stranded-work` with unresolved merge entries. That stranded-work branch is real follow-up work; it was not touched by this artifact commit.

## Sequence of Events

1. Removed the prior `.full-review/` output and ran the requested review flow for Code Mode code.
2. Dispatched parallel agents for the attached review issues, then implemented and verified the seven follow-up hardening suggestions.
3. Committed, pushed, opened PR 221, ran `lavra:lavra-review`, addressed the surfaced issues, and merged the PR into `main`.
4. Verified post-merge GitHub Actions and confirmed the live Labby MCP endpoint over Tailscale.
5. Ran the `vibin:save-to-md` maintenance pass, closed the completed parent bead, and wrote this session artifact on a clean branch.

## Key Findings

- PR 221 is merged at `edb2e89ff027b25df3d959a6fb07b3041a88d7d1`.
- Current `origin/main` HEAD is `5dc9861b0e6fbfc54b10864066ea2ee73cd92fc2`, which includes `ci: use nashost Tailscale endpoint for OpenWiki`.
- The canonical worktree `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab` is on `codex/land-stranded-work`, ahead of `origin/main` by 9 commits, with unresolved entries in Palette files and one modified MCP resource handler.
- The attached Codex worktree originally sat on deleted branch `codex/code-mode-review-hardening`; it was moved to `codex/save-session-2026-07-11` from `origin/main` for this artifact commit.
- No transcript file was found under `/home/jmagar/.claude/projects/*3605403a-59f6-451d-9fb5-23425aeffe47-lab/*.jsonl`.

## Technical Decisions

- Used a clean branch from `origin/main` for the session artifact so the mandatory path-limited commit could be clean and auditable.
- Did not delete worktrees or branches because several are active, locked, long-lived, or have unclear ownership.
- Closed only the completed parent bead `lab-mgeis`; all six child findings were already closed and had observed fix/verification evidence.
- Did not move `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md`; the filename and available evidence did not prove it was completed.

## Beads Activity

| bead | title | action | final status | why it mattered |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lab-mgeis` | Address Code Mode comprehensive review findings | Closed during save-to-md maintenance pass | closed | Parent task matched the completed review-hardening work and all children were closed. |
| `lab-mgeis.1` | Incus SSH bootstrap can hang past configured timeout | Created, commented, closed earlier in session | closed | Tracked wall-clock timeout and child process reaping fix. |
| `lab-mgeis.2` | Incus SSH bootstrap trusts unsafe or unused SSH config aliases | Created, commented, closed earlier in session | closed | Tracked unsafe SSH alias validation, `-F`, and `--` handling. |
| `lab-mgeis.3` | Incus SSH config parser silently ignores Include directives | Created, commented, closed earlier in session | closed | Tracked unsupported Include reporting. |
| `lab-mgeis.4` | Incus SSH setup error kinds are undocumented | Created, commented, closed earlier in session | closed | Tracked stable error-kind docs in `docs/dev/ERRORS.md`. |
| `lab-mgeis.5` | Code Mode docs omit invalid_code_mode_id canonical kind | Created and closed earlier in session | closed | Tracked Code Mode canonical error-kind docs. |
| `lab-mgeis.6` | Incus SSH CLI duplicates option normalization | Created and closed earlier in session | closed | Tracked CLI maintainability cleanup. |

## Repository Maintenance

- Plans: checked `docs/plans/`; `docs/plans/complete/mcp-streamable-http-oauth-proxy.md` was already complete, and `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` was left in place because completion was not proven.
- Beads: read `lab-mgeis` and all six children; closed `lab-mgeis` after observing the merged PR and passing checks.
- Worktrees and branches: inspected registered worktrees and local/remote branches. No worktrees or branches were removed because the dirty `codex/land-stranded-work` worktree, locked detached worktrees, long-lived `marketplace-no-mcp`, and active-looking feature branches were not safe cleanup targets.
- Stale docs: review-fix docs were already updated in `edb2e89f`; no additional stale-doc edits were made during the save pass.
- Transparency: the save artifact was written on `codex/save-session-2026-07-11` so it could be committed independently from the conflicted canonical worktree.

## Tools and Skills Used

- Shell commands: used `git`, `gh`, `bd`, `curl`, `incus`, and basic filesystem probes to inspect repo state, close tracker work, and verify endpoints.
- File tools: used patch-based file creation for this markdown artifact.
- Skills: used `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`, `lavra:lavra-review`, and `vibin:save-to-md`.
- Subagents: parallel agents were used for review issue implementation and review follow-up work.
- GitHub CLI: verified PR 221 and workflow runs.
- Labby/runtime probes: verified `http://100.99.0.1:40100/health` and `/mcp` auth behavior for the Tailscale endpoint.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
| --- | --- |
| `git switch -c codex/save-session-2026-07-11 origin/main` | Created a clean session-log branch from `origin/main`. |
| `gh pr view 221 --json number,title,url,state,mergedAt,mergeCommit` | Confirmed PR 221 was merged at `2026-07-11T12:36:13Z` with merge commit `edb2e89f`. |
| `gh run view 29153607666 --json ...` | Confirmed latest main CI at `5dc9861b` completed successfully. |
| `gh run view 29152908596 --json ...` | Confirmed Build Incus image at `edb2e89f` completed successfully. |
| `gh run view 29153258197 --json ...` | Confirmed release-please at `edb2e89f` completed successfully. |
| `bd show lab-mgeis --json` | Confirmed parent bead and all dependent child review issues. |
| `bd close lab-mgeis --reason ...` | Closed the parent review task after observing merged and verified work. |
| `git status --short --branch` in `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab` | Found `codex/land-stranded-work` ahead 9 with unresolved merge entries. |

## Errors Encountered

- `gh pr view --json ...` on the session-log branch returned no pull request, which is expected because this branch was created only for the session artifact.
- Transcript glob lookup found no matching `.jsonl` file for the attached Codex worktree, so no transcript-backed reconstruction was available.
- The canonical worktree is conflicted and was not suitable for the path-limited session artifact commit.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code Mode review hardening | Review findings and follow-up suggestions were not fully landed. | PR 221 merged the fixes and post-merge workflows passed. |
| Incus SSH setup | Timeout, unsafe alias, Include reporting, and docs issues existed in review scope. | Fixes and documentation landed in `edb2e89f`. |
| Labby MCP endpoint knowledge | The reachable Tailscale MCP endpoint was unclear. | Verified endpoint is `http://100.99.0.1:40100/mcp`. |
| Review tracker | Parent bead `lab-mgeis` remained open after child fixes. | Parent bead is closed. |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gh pr view 221 --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit` | PR merged | `state=MERGED`, merge commit `edb2e89f` | pass |
| `gh run view 29153607666 --json conclusion,headSha` | Latest main CI succeeds | `conclusion=success`, `headSha=5dc9861b` | pass |
| `gh run view 29152908596 --json conclusion,headSha` | Incus image build succeeds | `conclusion=success`, `headSha=edb2e89f` | pass |
| `gh run view 29153258197 --json conclusion,headSha` | release-please succeeds | `conclusion=success`, `headSha=edb2e89f` | pass |
| `curl http://100.99.0.1:40100/health` | Labby gateway health responds | Returned `{"status":"ok","mode":"gateway-host",...}` | pass |
| `curl -I http://100.99.0.1:40100/mcp` | MCP endpoint reachable and protected | Returned `401 Unauthorized` with OAuth protected-resource challenge | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- The save artifact branch is independent from `codex/land-stranded-work`; rollback is deleting the session-log commit or branch.
- The remaining risk is not in this artifact but in the conflicted canonical worktree. Resolve or abandon `codex/land-stranded-work` deliberately before using `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab` for new work.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not force-push, delete branches, or prune worktrees because current evidence did not prove those actions safe.
- Did not create a PR for the session-log branch during the write step; the save-to-md contract only required writing, committing, and pushing the generated artifact.
- Did not move the active-looking plan file under `docs/plans/` without direct completion evidence.

## Open Questions

- What is the intended fate of `codex/land-stranded-work` in `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab`? It is ahead of `origin/main` by 9 commits and has unresolved entries in Palette-related files plus a modified MCP resource handler.
- Should stale local branches with gone upstreams, such as `codex/code-mode-review-hardening` and `codex/lab-p8yxv-1-pagination`, be pruned after confirming no local-only value remains?

## Next Steps

1. In `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab`, inspect and resolve the `codex/land-stranded-work` conflicts:
   `git status --short --branch`
2. Decide whether the stranded Palette/MCP changes should become a PR, be split into smaller branches, or be abandoned.
3. After that branch is clean, run normal verification before any merge:
   `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, targeted tests, and CI as appropriate.
4. Prune obsolete review worktrees and gone-upstream branches only after the stranded branch is resolved.
