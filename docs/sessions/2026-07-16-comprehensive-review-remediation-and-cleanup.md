# Comprehensive review, remediation, merge, and repository cleanup

## User Request

Audit the entire project with the full comprehensive-review workflow without stopping, then dispatch parallel agents to fix every P0, P1, P2, and P3 finding. Finally, stage, commit, push, merge into <code>main</code>, synchronize the intentional <code>marketplace-no-mcp</code> branch, and leave only those two clean branches/worktrees.

## Session Overview

The review covered the entire tracked Lab project and validated 49 unique findings: 1 P0, 10 P1, 31 P2, and 7 P3. Parallel remediation resolved every code-, test-, documentation-, CI-, release-, performance-, and repository-controlled item, plus 13 additional delivery findings discovered during validation. The result landed through [PR #248](https://github.com/jmagar/labby/pull/248) as <code>e9c6577a</code>, with post-merge CI, Incus publication, and no-MCP synchronization green.

One operator-controlled security action remains: rotate the MCP Registry DNS publishing key and replace the GitHub secret. That work is tracked in <code>lab-fpsq9</code>; a published-history rewrite was deliberately not attempted without separate destructive authorization.

The injected transcript is a 2,209-line prior Claude session covering OAuth routing and release work from July 14–15. It was read during this closeout, but current-review facts below come from the live Git repository, review artifacts, GitHub, CI, and bead state rather than treating that older transcript as evidence for this Codex session.

## Sequence of Events

1. Established the live target, repository state, long-lived branch rules, project instructions, and all-features verification contract.
2. Ran the full-project review across quality, architecture, security, performance, testing, documentation/contracts, Rust/React practices, CI/CD, and operations; consolidated overlaps into 49 findings.
3. Dispatched parallel agents across independent remediation surfaces, integrated their changes, and repeatedly reviewed the combined tree.
4. Fixed all P0–P3 repository-controlled issues and 13 additional delivery findings exposed by tests, automated review, Windows, browser, release, and Incus validation.
5. Ran the full Rust, frontend, browser, Windows, security, docs, CI-policy, release, and image-publication verification matrix.
6. Pushed the remediation branch, merged PR #248 into <code>main</code>, deleted the merged feature refs/worktree, synchronized <code>marketplace-no-mcp</code>, and verified both retained worktrees were clean.
7. Closed review bead <code>lab-5j67j</code>, created follow-up bead <code>lab-fpsq9</code> for the external key rotation, and saved this docs-only artifact to <code>main</code>.

## Key Findings

- The final review report records the 49-finding distribution and baseline at [.full-review/05-final-report.md](../../.full-review/05-final-report.md#L7-L19); the remediation contract explicitly kept F-01 through F-49 in scope at [.full-review/05-final-report.md](../../.full-review/05-final-report.md#L243-L247).
- Active credential material had been published and suppressed by the leak baseline; the current tree was redacted and scanning policy repaired, while DNS publisher key rotation remains an external operator action ([report lines 37–43](../../.full-review/05-final-report.md#L37-L43)).
- Authorization and admin-policy drift existed across Setup, Doctor, MCP, HTTP, generated contracts, and the local bootstrap capability ([report lines 45–85](../../.full-review/05-final-report.md#L45-L85)).
- Cancellation and partial-commit hazards existed in gateway reload/save and Code Mode execution; runtime replacement now preserves the live pool until a ready replacement can be swapped, and request state has bounded/drop-safe cleanup ([report lines 59–73](../../.full-review/05-final-report.md#L59-L73)).
- CI and release surfaces could report success or publish before all critical gates completed; the final workflows aggregate required tests, pin actions/tools, validate release inputs, preserve rollback targets, and publish through a validated draft/tag handoff.
- The later delivery pass found and fixed 13 more issues, including restored-inspector minimization, iframe shrinking, Windows ACL module inheritance, cargo-deny drift, Node runtime pins, distrobuilder probing, bootstrap proxy scope, zero-limit pagination, cursor exposure, rollback preservation, and release-draft promotion ([report lines 21–35](../../.full-review/05-final-report.md#L21-L35)).

## Technical Decisions

- Preserved <code>marketplace-no-mcp</code> as an intentional long-lived variant and synchronized it from <code>main</code>; it was neither merged into <code>main</code> nor deleted.
- Kept business and policy logic in neutral/shared layers, with CLI, MCP, HTTP, and web surfaces remaining adapters; new architecture tests enforce those boundaries.
- Used fail-closed, metadata-derived admin policy and generated-contract parity instead of service-specific authorization allowlists.
- Used build-beside-live plus atomic swap for gateway reload, bounded guards for Code Mode, keyset/cursor pagination for usage, and backup-first atomic secret/config writes.
- Kept destructive external actions out of scope: key rotation requires Cloudflare/GitHub authority, and rewriting published history requires explicit separate authorization.
- Landed remediation by squash merge through PR #248, then performed explicit branch/worktree and remote ancestry checks before cleanup.

## Beads Activity

| bead | title | actions | final status | why it mattered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <code>lab-5j67j</code> | Comprehensive full-project review and remediation | Worked throughout the review; closed after merge and verification | closed | Tracked the full F-01–F-49 review/remediation outcome |
| <code>lab-fpsq9</code> | Rotate MCP Registry DNS publishing key | Searched for an existing issue, found none, then created a P1 follow-up | open | Keeps the external secret rotation and workflow verification visible instead of burying it in prose |

The local <code>bd close</code> and <code>bd create</code> operations succeeded. Their automatic MySQL backup/sync attempt timed out against <code>100.99.0.3:3311</code>; local bead state remained authoritative and was verified from command output.

## Repository Maintenance

- Plans: <code>docs/plans/complete/mcp-streamable-http-oauth-proxy.md</code> was already filed as complete. <code>docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md</code> remains active/ambiguous and was deliberately not moved.
- Beads: closed completed review bead <code>lab-5j67j</code>; created open P1 follow-up <code>lab-fpsq9</code> for the only remaining operator-controlled action.
- Worktrees and branches: removed the merged feature worktree/branch and stale proven-safe backup ref during delivery. Final local state retained only clean <code>main</code> and clean <code>marketplace-no-mcp</code>; both matched their remotes before this session-log commit.
- Remote state: deleted the merged feature remote. Preserved the active Release Please branch for [PR #247](https://github.com/jmagar/labby/pull/247), because it is automation-owned and unmerged.
- Stale docs: regenerated action/MCP/OpenAPI/service contracts, refreshed OpenWiki and runtime CI/OAuth docs, removed stale duplicate <code>docs/CHANGELOG.md</code>, and passed docs/OpenWiki checks. No additional safe stale-doc move or rewrite was identified.
- Transparency: no dirty or unmerged user work was discarded. The no-MCP worktree had a temporary local wrapper diff identical to incoming remote content; it was named-stashed, fast-forwarded, hash-compared, then the verified redundant stash was dropped.

## Tools and Skills Used

- Skills: the named <code>comprehensive-review:full-review</code> workflow drove the whole-project audit; <code>vibin:save-to-md</code> drove this maintenance pass, artifact structure, path-limited commit, and default-branch landing.
- Parallel agents: independent agents reviewed and remediated security/auth, gateway/runtime, frontend/Palette, testing/docs, CI/release, and delivery-review findings; shared-tree integration was followed by root-level verification.
- Shell and file tools: <code>rg</code>, Git, Cargo/nextest/clippy/fmt/deny, Bun/TypeScript/Vite, Python policy tests, actionlint, GitHub CLI, Beads, Incus/distrobuilder, and path-limited patching were used for inspection, implementation, orchestration, and verification.
- Browser and platform tooling: Playwright browser scenarios exercised Gateway Admin; Windows self-hosted CI verified ACL and Job Object behavior; Incus jobs verified build, boot, provision, and rolling publication.
- GitHub/external checks: <code>gh</code> inspected PRs, reviews, checks, actions, release automation, and Dependabot alert #77. Official action metadata and release-please schema were consulted when resolving delivery findings.
- Issues encountered: late automated-review findings required additional remediation cycles; GitHub merge changed local branch assumptions; MySQL bead backup timed out; no force push, destructive reset, or unverified cleanup was used.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| <code>git status --short --branch</code>, <code>git worktree list --porcelain</code>, <code>git branch -vv</code> | Proved the active checkout and final two-worktree topology |
| <code>rg</code> and targeted source/doc inspection | Built and cross-checked the full review evidence |
| <code>just test</code> | 2,076 passed, 8 skipped |
| <code>just build</code>, <code>just lint</code>, <code>just deny</code> | All-features build, formatting/clippy, and advisory/license gates passed |
| <code>just docs-check</code> plus OpenWiki and CI policy scripts | Generated contracts, links, policy, and changed-path classifiers passed |
| Gateway Admin unit, typecheck, build, installer, browser, and bundle-budget commands | 340 unit tests, 2 installer tests, 5 browser scenarios, and budgets passed |
| Palette renderer, typecheck, Vite, Tauri, and advisory commands | Palette verification passed |
| <code>gh pr create/view/checks/merge</code> and <code>gh run view</code> | PR #248 merged and post-merge workflows were confirmed green |
| no-MCP drift checks plus branch hash/ancestry comparisons | Variant branch synchronized without marketplace drift |
| <code>bd close lab-5j67j</code> and <code>bd create ...</code> | Review closed; key-rotation follow-up created as <code>lab-fpsq9</code> |
| <code>git add -f -- artifact</code> and <code>git commit --only -- artifact</code> | Reserved for the final docs-only session artifact commit |

## Errors Encountered

- <strong>Post-merge checkout assumption:</strong> the PR merge succeeded, but a follow-up checkout path failed because <code>main</code> was already owned by the root worktree. The merged state was confirmed with GitHub and cleanup continued from the correct worktree.
- <strong>Late review findings:</strong> automated reviewers continued to identify P1/P2 delivery defects after the initial remediation. Each was reproduced or disproved against generated output, fixed when valid, and reverified before merge.
- <strong>Patch context collisions:</strong> a few repeated-line patches failed to match uniquely. They were reapplied one occurrence at a time with local context.
- <strong>No-MCP temporary drift:</strong> the local wrapper diff exactly matched incoming remote content. A named stash protected it during fast-forward; hashes proved redundancy before dropping the stash.
- <strong>Beads backup timeout:</strong> automatic MySQL backup sync timed out, but the local close/create operations succeeded. No tracker action was falsely reported as remotely synchronized.
- <strong>Required-check query ambiguity:</strong> <code>gh pr checks --required</code> reported no configured required checks; the full check set and aggregate gates were separately inspected and confirmed green.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication and Setup | Mutation/admin/bootstrap policy could drift by surface; RSA/JWT and secret-file handling had security gaps | Metadata-derived fail-closed policy, scoped local bootstrap, modern signing path, redaction, and restrictive secret persistence |
| Gateway runtime | Reload cancellation could leave no live pool; saves could partially commit; reprobes could herd | Build-beside-live atomic swap, transactional/compensated saves, cancellation propagation, bounded jittered reprobes |
| Code Mode and usage | Execution state and journals were unbounded; cancellation leaked state; deep OFFSET pagination and zero-limit panic existed | Aggregate budgets, drop-safe cleanup, bounded artifacts, keyset cursor pagination, zero-limit handling |
| Gateway Admin and Palette | Dialog/editor code shipped eagerly; inspector restore/shrink behavior regressed; Palette gates were incomplete | Lazy route loading, bundle budgets, stable inspector/minimize/resize behavior, full renderer/Tauri/advisory gates |
| Contracts and docs | Admin requirements and stable errors were incomplete/stale across generated surfaces and OpenWiki | Generated policy parity, complete status mapping, regenerated docs, validated OpenWiki |
| CI and releases | Critical jobs were outside <code>ci-gate</code>; mutable actions/tools and early publication weakened integrity | Complete aggregation, pinned actions/tools, strict preflight, draft/tag validation, rollback-safe atomic publication and provenance |
| Repository hygiene | Feature refs/worktrees and review artifacts were in flight | Remediation merged; only <code>main</code> and <code>marketplace-no-mcp</code> remain locally, with intentional automation refs preserved remotely |

| Final repo status before artifact | clean main; only intended local branches/worktrees | observed exactly <code>main</code> and <code>marketplace-no-mcp</code>, both clean and synced | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- The squash commit is broad because all 49 priorities were explicitly in scope. Reverting <code>e9c6577a</code> would roll back the remediation as one unit, but would also reintroduce security, correctness, and release-integrity defects; targeted reverts are safer for isolated regressions.
- Release changes intentionally preserve pre-existing public releases and container versions during rollback. The validated stable tag/draft handoff prevents partial public promotion.
- Key rotation remains time-sensitive because current-tree redaction does not revoke material already exposed in history. Rotate first; decide separately whether to rewrite published history.
- The no-MCP variant is automation-synchronized from <code>main</code>; future main commits, including this session log, should be allowed to pass through its sync workflow before declaring both local worktrees current again.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not rewrite Git history or force-push to purge historical credential material; that destructive operation needs separate explicit authorization and coordination.
- Did not invent or rotate the MCP Registry DNS signing key without Cloudflare/GitHub secret authority.
- Did not merge <code>marketplace-no-mcp</code> into <code>main</code> or delete it; project instructions define it as intentional and long-lived.
- Did not delete the Release Please branch for PR #247; it is active automation state.
- Did not move <code>docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md</code> into completed plans because its status was not proven complete.

## Open Questions

- Who will perform the Cloudflare/GitHub-authorized MCP Registry DNS publishing-key rotation tracked by <code>lab-fpsq9</code>?
- After rotation and workflow verification, is a coordinated destructive rewrite of published repository history authorized?
- Is <code>docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md</code> still active, or can a future maintenance pass move it to <code>docs/plans/complete/</code>?

## Next Steps

- <strong>Blocked external action:</strong> complete <code>lab-fpsq9</code> by rotating the DNS publishing key, replacing the GitHub secret, and validating a safe publish.
- <strong>Follow-on decision:</strong> explicitly authorize or decline a coordinated history rewrite only after all exposed credentials are rotated.
- <strong>Automation:</strong> let the docs-only main commit trigger the normal <code>marketplace-no-mcp</code> synchronization, then fast-forward the local no-MCP worktree and rerun its drift/status checks.
- <strong>Immediate verification:</strong> confirm this artifact commit contains only this Markdown path, push it to <code>main</code>, pull fast-forward, and verify both retained worktrees are clean.
