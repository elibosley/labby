# OAuth callback relay and Zed auth session

## User Request

The session began with Codex MCP OAuth completing in the browser but not finishing in the CLI, then expanded into documenting client setup, reviewing the existing public callback relay on `edgehost`, planning and implementing that relay inside Labby, debugging Zed and MCPJam OAuth callback failures, and saving the session as markdown.

## Session Overview

The public OAuth callback relay epic was implemented on PR #239 and pushed to `codex/public-oauth-callback-relay`. The branch is clean, pushed, and mergeable; CI run `29336998822` passed on head `c80f720a`.

The debugging work found that Codex has configurable public callback knobs for headless/remote cases, while Zed currently has OAuth client-credential knobs but no callback URL or port override. The practical Zed workaround applied during the session was to configure a static `Authorization: Bearer ...` header in the Windows Zed settings through the Labby-accessible `winhost` Windows MCP path, bypassing Zed's fragile loopback OAuth callback flow.

## Sequence of Events

1. Investigated why browser-side MCP OAuth completion did not always finish in CLI clients.
2. Documented the distinction between normal desktop OAuth flows and headless/remote Codex flows that need public callback configuration.
3. Located and reviewed the standalone callback relay running on `edgehost`, including relay code, registry behavior, SWAG proxying, helper scripts, tests, and architecture docs.
4. Built and reviewed a plan for folding the relay into Labby, integrating Lavra research and engineering-review feedback.
5. Implemented the Labby public relay on PR #239 with public callback routes, registry persistence/import, admin API/CLI surfaces, doctor checks, docs, and generated help updates.
6. Ran live smokes and CI checks, then addressed PR review findings in follow-up commits.
7. Debugged MCPJam and Zed OAuth failures and confirmed Zed's current source lacks callback override settings.
8. Verified the implementation branch and main checkout were clean and pushed, then generated this session log on `main`.

## Key Findings

- Codex remote/headless clients can use `mcp_oauth_callback_url` and `mcp_oauth_callback_port`; regular non-headless desktop flows should generally not need config edits.
- The standalone relay on `edgehost` was a transport-only FastAPI relay with public `GET|POST /callback/{machine_id}[/{suffix}]`, registry-backed target lookup, and a `/healthz` public health check.
- Labby's public relay must keep the existing public callback contract while hardening registry validation, query/body/response limits, redirects, headers, target policy, logging, and admin mutation boundaries.
- Zed has an MCP `oauth` config object for `client_id` and optional `client_secret`, but current Zed source still starts an ephemeral loopback server and sends that generated `redirect_uri` in the authorization and token exchange flow.
- For Zed, setting an `Authorization` header on the remote MCP server config bypasses OAuth prompting and avoids the unreachable/incorrect local callback topology.

## Technical Decisions

- Keep PR #239 implementation on `codex/public-oauth-callback-relay`; this session-log commit is separate on `main`.
- Preserve the public callback URL contract `https://callback.tootie.tv/callback/{machine_id}[/{suffix}]` for compatibility.
- Treat the relay as transport-only: it forwards callbacks and never exchanges OAuth codes, stores PKCE state, or edits client credential stores.
- Use a relay-specific Tailscale target policy instead of Labby's generic SSRF helper because the relay intentionally targets `http://100.x.x.x:38935/callback/<machine>`.
- Use bearer-header auth for Zed's current setup because Zed's available OAuth knobs do not let Labby control the callback URL.

## Files Changed

These implementation files are changed on PR branch `codex/public-oauth-callback-relay` relative to `main`; this save-session commit on `main` adds only this markdown file.

## Repository Maintenance

### Plans

- Checked `docs/plans/`; `docs/plans/complete/mcp-streamable-http-oauth-proxy.md` was already in `complete/`.
- Left `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` in place because it is an open fleet WebSocket plan and unrelated to this OAuth relay session.

### Beads

- Checked recent bead interactions and narrowed to OAuth relay review beads.
- No new bead was created for this save-session step; relevant implementation and review beads were already present and closed where appropriate.

### Worktrees and branches

- Main worktree `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab` was clean and even with `origin/main`.
- PR worktree `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab/.worktrees/public-oauth-callback-relay` was clean and even with `origin/codex/public-oauth-callback-relay`.
- `codex/mise-toolchain-lab-20260713110254` and `claude/test-237-passing-8d1ffe` were clean and ancestry-safe relative to `origin/main`, but left in place because they predate this session.
- `marketplace-no-mcp` was left untouched because it is an intentional long-lived variant branch and its worktree had a dirty `scripts/cargo-rustc-wrapper`.
- `release-please--branches--main--components--labby` was left untouched because PR #238 is open.

### Stale docs

- The session updated OAuth runtime and callback relay documentation on PR #239.
- No additional stale-doc edit was made during this save-session pass; the only main-branch change is this generated session artifact.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Shell commands.** Used `git`, `gh`, `bd`, `find`, `sed`, `curl`, and date/status commands for repo evidence, PR state, branch ancestry, CI state, and tracker state.
- **Skills.** Used `vibin:save-to-md` for this session artifact; earlier session work used Lavra planning/research/review skills, Superpowers debugging/plan skills, and Vibin work/Windows-MCP flows.
- **Labby gateway and MCP tools.** Used Labby to discover/use the registered `winhost` Windows MCP surface and apply a Zed settings workaround on Windows.
- **Browser/web research.** Used official Zed docs and current Zed GitHub source to verify OAuth settings and callback behavior.
- **External CLIs.** Used GitHub CLI for PR and CI verification and Beads CLI for local tracker evidence.
- **Issues encountered.** `bd list --all` produced very large/truncated output; the note uses narrowed `bd show` evidence for relevant beads. A Codex transcript search found archived/session files but no authoritative current markdown transcript path was injected by the skill.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `git status --short --branch` | Main checkout clean and even with `origin/main` before writing this file |
| `git status --short --branch` in `.worktrees/public-oauth-callback-relay` | PR worktree clean and even with `origin/codex/public-oauth-callback-relay` |
| `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...@{upstream}` | Main and PR branch each returned `0 0` before this session-log commit |
| `gh pr view --json number,state,mergeStateStatus,headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,url,title` | PR #239 open, clean, head `c80f720a`, base `main` |
| `gh run list --branch codex/public-oauth-callback-relay --limit 5 --json ...` | Latest CI run `29336998822` completed successfully on `c80f720a` |
| `git worktree list --porcelain && git branch -vv && git branch -r -vv` | Listed main, PR, release-please, marketplace, and older mise/test worktrees |
| `bd show lab-87euc lab-87euc.8 lab-wj0on lab-wypwm lab-i7oh0 lab-m3myh --json` | Confirmed epic and review bead states |
| `curl -L -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zed-industries/zed/main/...` | Confirmed Zed OAuth callback code path and settings shape |

## Errors Encountered

- Codex CLI initially appeared stuck after the browser said authentication was complete; the later retry succeeded and printed `Successfully logged in to MCP server 'labby'`.
- MCPJam showed `ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR` for an HTTPS local callback URL; changing to `http` made auth work, pointing at a scheme mismatch rather than a Labby token-exchange failure.
- Zed showed `127.0.0.1 took too long to respond` for local callback URLs; live debugging found no listener on the callback port in the expected Windows context and Zed logs reported callback shutdown/invalid request errors.
- Current Zed source confirmed the root cause was not configurable away with `oauth.client_id`: Zed still generates its own ephemeral loopback `redirect_uri`.
- During this save step, `bd list --all` and Beads interaction output were too large for a useful full capture, so the session note uses narrowed `bd show` and PR evidence.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Labby public callback relay | Standalone Python/FastAPI relay on `edgehost` owned the public callback path | PR #239 adds a Labby-owned public callback relay implementation and cutover docs |
| Codex headless OAuth docs | Client setup requirements were unclear during remote/headless auth | `docs/runtime/OAUTH.md` on main includes Codex MCP OAuth client setup guidance |
| Zed MCP auth on `winhost` | Zed attempted OAuth and failed on loopback callback delivery | Zed settings were updated externally to use a static bearer `Authorization` header |
| Relay registry imports | Review found duplicate IDs and unsupported versions could be mishandled | PR #239 follow-up commit rejects ambiguous duplicate IDs and unsupported registry versions |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gh run list --branch codex/public-oauth-callback-relay --limit 5 --json ...` | Latest PR CI passes | Run `29336998822` on `c80f720a` concluded `success` | pass |
| `gh pr view 239 --json state,mergeStateStatus` | PR open and mergeable | `state=OPEN`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN` | pass |
| `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...@{upstream}` in PR worktree | Branch pushed, no divergence | `0 0` | pass |
| `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...@{upstream}` on main | Main pushed, no divergence before session artifact | `0 0` | pass |
| Windows MCP initialize smoke from `winhost` to `https://labby.tootie.tv/mcp` | Remote Zed-compatible bearer path responds | HTTP 200 initialize response observed during debugging | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- PR #239 is not merged yet; rollback is to close or update that PR without touching `main`.
- Public relay cutover still requires runtime deployment and SWAG proxy changes; rollback for cutover is documented as returning SWAG to the standalone Python relay container.
- Zed bearer-header workaround depends on the configured token staying current; rotating `LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` requires updating the Windows Zed settings again.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not attempt to patch Zed in this repo; the callback override gap is upstream Zed behavior.
- Did not delete old merged worktrees during save-to-md because they were outside this session's implementation scope.
- Did not merge PR #239 as part of this closeout; the user's last explicit question was whether everything was committed and pushed.
- Did not move the open fleet WebSocket plan to `docs/plans/complete/` because it remains an active/open plan.

## Open Questions

- Whether to propose an upstream Zed setting for callback URL/port override, or keep using static bearer auth for Labby in Zed.
- Whether to remove old clean merged worktrees in a dedicated cleanup pass.
- Whether PR #239 should merge before or after the runtime/SWAG cutover plan is rehearsed.

## Next Steps

- Review and merge PR #239 when ready.
- Deploy the Labby relay runtime and perform the SWAG cutover using `docs/deploy/CALLBACK_RELAY.md`.
- After cutover, run live OAuth smokes for Codex and a browser client through `https://callback.tootie.tv`.
- Keep Zed configured with the bearer header unless upstream Zed gains a callback override or Labby adds a Zed-specific compatible flow.
