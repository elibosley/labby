# Npm and MCP Registry publication session

## User Request

The session began with a request to remove `.full-review/`, run a comprehensive MCP-focused review, dispatch agents to fix the surfaced MCP issues, harden CI and registry validation, then stage, commit, push, review, merge, repair OpenWiki workflows, and publish Labby through npm and the official MCP Registry.

## Session Overview

This session landed the npm launcher and MCP Registry metadata for Labby, published `labby-mcp@1.1.0` and then `labby-mcp@1.2.0`, published MCP Registry metadata for `ai.dinglebear/labby` at those versions, and merged PR #229 into `main` as `a0db54c1`.

The session also repaired OpenWiki workflow configuration across multiple repos, updated the npm wrapper documentation pattern in `~/docs`, configured MCP Registry DNS credentials, and created a follow-up bead for missing `v1.2.0` Windows and Incus release assets after the tag release workflow ended cancelled.

## Sequence of Events

1. Removed `.full-review/` and ran MCP-scoped comprehensive review work, then dispatched agents for the first three security/best-practice findings and later for fifteen MCP hardening issues.
2. Added or confirmed focused CI coverage for route-scoped MCP resources/tools, upstream `ui://` route scope, list pagination, elicitation timeout and relay env alias behavior, registry canonical serde, and metadata namespace validation.
3. Merged the protected Axon/OpenWiki workflow-fix PRs, investigated OpenWiki workflow behavior across other repos, and adjusted OpenWiki workflows to use the nashost Tailscale OpenWiki endpoint through repo configuration instead of the old `cli-api` path.
4. Built and synced the latest Labby binary into the Incus container, then researched official MCP Registry publishing and DNS authentication.
5. Chose `dinglebear.ai` as the MCP Registry namespace, configured the DNS key flow, and rejected `https://lab.tootie.tv/mcp` as a public registry endpoint because it is not a public transport.
6. Added the npm wrapper package and canonical `server.json`, chose npm package distribution for the MCP Registry entry, and deferred OCI registration until the container image label/release surface is complete.
7. Published `labby-mcp@1.1.0` and `ai.dinglebear/labby@1.1.0`, then aligned the branch with `origin/main` release `v1.2.0` and published `labby-mcp@1.2.0` plus MCP Registry `ai.dinglebear/labby@1.2.0`.
8. Merged `origin/main` into PR #229, resolved OpenWiki privacy conflicts by keeping main's repo-variable endpoint behavior, reran CI after a transient Windows self-hosted `sccache` failure, and squash-merged PR #229 into `main`.
9. Uploaded the Linux `v1.2.0` release archive/checksum manually after the npm wrapper initially failed on missing release assets, verified `npx --yes labby-mcp@1.2.0 --version`, and created bead `lab-5vssx` for the missing Windows and Incus artifacts.
10. Switched the save-session worktree from the deleted PR branch to updated `main`, pruned the obsolete local PR branch, and wrote this session artifact.

## Key Findings

- PR #229 merged successfully at `a0db54c1ed71573de5c2a7a065b560cdf69a98cd`.
- `labby-mcp@1.2.0` exists on npm and the Linux install path works: `npx --yes labby-mcp@1.2.0 --version` returned `labby 1.2.0`.
- The `v1.2.0` tag release workflow run `29180258387` ended `cancelled`; only the Linux archive and checksum are attached to the GitHub release.
- The PR CI run `29181340128` completed successfully after rerunning a transient Windows self-hosted test failure caused by `sccache` losing its server connection.
- The stale local branch `codex/openwiki-tailscale-endpoint` was safe to remove because PR #229 was merged and GitHub deleted its remote branch.

## Technical Decisions

- Used an npm wrapper package in `server.json` instead of a remote transport because the proposed `lab.tootie.tv` MCP URL is not public.
- Deferred OCI registry publication because the existing GHCR image did not yet provide the required MCP package labeling and complete release surface.
- Kept trusted npm publishing as the preferred release path, while updating the local docs to retain token-based publishing as a first-time or fallback path.
- Kept the OpenWiki endpoint private by relying on repository variables instead of hardcoding Tailscale IPs or hostnames in public workflow files.
- Uploaded the Linux `v1.2.0` release archive manually to unblock the already-published Linux npm install path while tracking full asset restoration separately.

## Beads Activity

| bead | title | action | final status | why it mattered |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lab-p8yxv.1` | Optimize MCP list pagination to avoid rebuilding full catalogs per page | Read during maintenance pass. | closed | Confirms the requested pagination agent work was already merged in PR #226 with green CI evidence. |
| `lab-p8yxv.2` | Extract shared MCP peer catalog notification fanout | Read during maintenance pass. | closed | Confirms the requested peer fanout agent work was already merged in PR #225. |
| `lab-5vssx` | Restore missing v1.2.0 Windows and Incus release artifacts | Created during maintenance pass. | open | Tracks the cancelled tag release workflow and missing non-Linux release assets after Linux npm smoke was unblocked. |

## Repository Maintenance

### Plans

- Checked `docs/plans/`; observed `docs/plans/complete/mcp-streamable-http-oauth-proxy.md` already under `complete/` and `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` still outside `complete/`.
- No plan files were moved because the remaining `docs/plans/` file was not proven complete from this session evidence.
- Also observed many historical files under `docs/superpowers/plans/`, including `2026-07-11-lab-p8yxv-1-pagination.md` and `2026-07-11-lab-p8yxv-2-peer-fanout.md`; these are outside the `docs/plans/` cleanup path named by the skill and were left untouched.

### Beads

- Read exact beads `lab-p8yxv.1` and `lab-p8yxv.2`; both were already closed with merged PR evidence.
- Created `lab-5vssx` for the incomplete `v1.2.0` release asset set.
- `git status --short --branch` stayed clean after bead creation, so the tracker write did not add git-tracked files to the session commit.

### Worktrees and branches

- Inspected registered worktrees and branches with `git worktree list --porcelain`, `git branch -vv`, and `git branch -r -vv`.
- Deleted local branch `codex/openwiki-tailscale-endpoint` after PR #229 was observed merged and `git ls-remote --heads origin codex/openwiki-tailscale-endpoint` returned no remote branch.
- Left active or ambiguous worktrees/branches untouched, including `codex/lab-p8yxv-1-pagination`, `codex/lab-p8yxv-2-peer-fanout`, locked initializing detached worktrees, and the long-lived `marketplace-no-mcp` worktree.

### Stale docs

- During the session, updated `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/node-entrypoint-rust-mcp.md` to explain npm trusted publishing and token fallback.
- No additional repo docs were changed during the closeout pass because the observed repo docs already matched the merged PR #229 behavior.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Skills.** Used `vibin:save-to-md` for this session artifact; earlier work used requested review/workflow skills including `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`, `lavra:lavra-review`, `lavra:lavra-research`, `lavra:lavra-eng-review`, `superpowers:writing-plans`, `vibin:work-it`, `vibin:quick-push`, and `vibin:gh-fix-ci`.
- **Subagents.** Dispatched agents for the MCP review issues and for beads `lab-p8yxv.1` and `lab-p8yxv.2`.
- **Shell and CLIs.** Used `git`, `gh`, `cargo`, `npm`, `npx`, `mcp-publisher`, `actionlint`, `bd`, and `chezmoi`.
- **MCP and search tools.** Used Lumen semantic search first for repository discovery in this save step. Earlier session work included web research for official MCP Registry publishing and DNS authentication.
- **Browser/image context.** Used the user's npm trusted-publisher screenshot to align the npm publishing flow with GitHub Actions OIDC instead of only token auth.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
| --- | --- |
| `git switch main` and `git pull --ff-only origin main` | Updated the save-session worktree to `origin/main` at `a0db54c1`. |
| `git merge origin/main` on PR branch | Merged current main into PR #229 before final CI; conflicts were resolved by keeping main's privacy-safe OpenWiki workflow files. |
| `npm test --prefix packages/labby-mcp` | Passed before publish. |
| `npm run check --prefix packages/labby-mcp` | Passed before publish. |
| `npm pack --dry-run --json ./packages/labby-mcp` | Passed before publish. |
| `mcp-publisher publish server.json` | Published MCP Registry metadata for `ai.dinglebear/labby`. |
| `cargo test -p labby --test ci_changed_paths --locked` | Passed 10 focused CI path tests. |
| `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/release.yml .github/workflows/release-please.yml .github/workflows/openwiki-update.yml` | Passed with no output. |
| `gh run rerun 29181340128 --failed` | Reran the failed Windows self-hosted CI job; rerun passed. |
| `gh pr merge 229 --squash --delete-branch` | Merged PR #229 into `main`. |
| `gh release upload v1.2.0 ... --clobber` | Uploaded Linux archive and checksum to unblock Linux npm installs. |
| `npx --yes labby-mcp@1.2.0 --version` | Returned `labby 1.2.0`. |
| `bd create "Restore missing v1.2.0 Windows and Incus release artifacts" ...` | Created follow-up bead `lab-5vssx`. |
| `git branch -D codex/openwiki-tailscale-endpoint` | Removed obsolete local PR branch after PR #229 merge and remote branch deletion were observed. |

## Errors Encountered

- **Npm token/trusted publishing confusion.** Token-based publish access was initially unclear even though the token was new. The session resolved this by documenting trusted publishing as the primary path and token publishing as a fallback/first-time path.
- **Incorrect public endpoint candidate.** `https://lab.tootie.tv/mcp` was rejected for registry metadata because it is not a public MCP endpoint.
- **Initial npm smoke failed.** `npx --yes labby-mcp@1.2.0 --version` initially failed with a 404 because the `v1.2.0` GitHub release had no Linux archive. Uploading the Linux archive/checksum fixed the Linux smoke.
- **Windows CI flake.** PR CI job `Test (windows self-hosted)` failed because `sccache` lost its server connection while compiling `labby-gateway` (`os error 10054`). Rerunning failed jobs made the Windows test and `ci-gate` pass.
- **Tag release workflow incomplete.** Release workflow run `29180258387` ended `cancelled`; Linux and container jobs succeeded, Windows was cancelled, and Incus image/Create Release jobs were skipped. Follow-up bead `lab-5vssx` tracks restoration.
- **Artifact download quirk.** A broad `gh run download` attempt hit a Docker `.dockerbuild` artifact extraction error; downloading the named Linux artifact succeeded.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm install | No published npm launcher package for Labby MCP distribution. | `labby-mcp@1.2.0` is published and works on Linux via `npx`. |
| MCP Registry | No canonical `server.json` publication for `ai.dinglebear/labby`. | MCP Registry metadata was published for versions `1.1.0` and `1.2.0`. |
| release automation | Release workflow did not publish npm launcher or MCP Registry metadata. | Release workflow includes npm trusted-publisher and MCP Registry publish jobs. |
| CI path gating | npm launcher and `server.json` changes were not separately classified. | CI classifier routes npm/registry metadata changes to focused checks. |
| OpenWiki workflows | Some repos/workflows were using stale or non-operational OpenWiki endpoint behavior. | Workflow fixes use the nashost Tailscale OpenWiki endpoint through repo configuration and protected PRs were merged. |
| docs pattern | The npm wrapper doc emphasized token publishing. | The doc now explains trusted publishing as primary and token auth as fallback. |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo test -p labby --test ci_changed_paths --locked` | Focused CI path tests pass. | 10 passed, 0 failed. | pass |
| `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/release.yml .github/workflows/release-please.yml .github/workflows/openwiki-update.yml` | Workflow syntax clean. | No output; exit 0. | pass |
| `npm test --prefix packages/labby-mcp` | npm launcher tests pass. | Passed. | pass |
| `npm run check --prefix packages/labby-mcp` | npm package validation passes. | Passed. | pass |
| `npm pack --dry-run --json ./packages/labby-mcp` | Package can be packed. | Passed. | pass |
| `gh run view 29181340128 --repo jmagar/labby ...` | PR CI is green. | Workflow conclusion `success`; `ci-gate` success. | pass |
| `gh pr view 229 --repo jmagar/labby ...` | PR #229 merged. | State `MERGED`, merge commit `a0db54c1`. | pass |
| `npm view labby-mcp@1.2.0 version` | Published npm version exists. | `1.2.0`. | pass |
| `npx --yes labby-mcp@1.2.0 --version` | Published npm launcher runs. | `labby 1.2.0`. | pass |
| `gh release view v1.2.0 --repo jmagar/labby ...` | Release has assets needed by npm wrapper. | Linux archive/checksum present; Windows and Incus assets absent. | warn |
| `gh run view 29180258387 --repo jmagar/labby ...` | Tag release completed. | Workflow conclusion `cancelled`. | warn |

## Risks and Rollback

- Published npm and MCP Registry versions are externally visible. If metadata or packaging needs correction, the practical rollback is to publish a new fixed version rather than relying on deletion.
- Linux npm installs are verified, but Windows npm installs may fail until `lab-5vssx` is resolved because the Windows release archive is absent.
- The release workflow cancellation means the manual Linux asset upload is a partial release repair, not a full release completion.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not register `lab.tootie.tv` as a remote MCP endpoint because it is not public.
- Did not switch the MCP Registry entry to OCI yet because the current image/release surface is not ready for that distribution path.
- Did not hardcode Tailscale IPs in public workflow files; repo variables remain the privacy-safe OpenWiki configuration path.
- Did not delete active, locked, or ambiguous worktrees/branches during maintenance.
- Did not move historical `docs/superpowers/plans/` files as part of this save because the skill cleanup rule targeted `docs/plans/`.

## Open Questions

- Should `v1.2.0` be repaired in place by rerunning/backfilling the Windows and Incus assets, or should a follow-up `v1.2.1` release replace it?
- Should old active worktrees such as `codex/lab-p8yxv-1-pagination`, `codex/save-session-2026-07-11`, and locked detached worktrees be cleaned in a dedicated worktree-maintenance pass?
- Should OCI distribution be added once the GHCR image label and release asset flow are fully ready?

## Next Steps

- Resolve `lab-5vssx`: rerun or repair the release workflow so `v1.2.0` has Windows archive/checksum and Incus image assets, or publish a documented replacement release.
- Smoke `labby-mcp@1.2.0` on Windows after the Windows archive exists.
- Consider a separate branch/worktree cleanup task for stale worktrees and old branches that were intentionally left alone here.
- Continue using trusted npm publishing for normal releases, with the documented token path reserved for fallback or bootstrap cases.
