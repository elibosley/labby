# Labby server identity fix — deploy completion and session closeout

Completion record for the session documented in
[2026-07-16-labby-connector-investigation-and-server-identity-fix.md](2026-07-16-labby-connector-investigation-and-server-identity-fix.md).
That doc was written mid-session (pre-commit, per quick-push contract) with the PR/merge/deploy listed as in-flight; this doc records the completed pipeline, final verification, and the closeout maintenance pass. Investigation detail lives in the prior doc and is only summarized here.

## User Request

Session arc: "is labby currently running rn? can you check the latest logs" → root-cause "Claude Desktop completes OAuth but shows no connection and no error" → "check all the logs" → apply the MCP serverInfo fix → `/vibin:quick-push and merge it into main and get the new binary built and synced to the incus container` → this `/vibin:save-to-md` closeout.

## Session Overview

Confirmed labby healthy in the `labby` Incus container; proved the Desktop connector symptom is client-side (three OAuth flows completed and verified server-side, live widget traffic served 49s before the first re-auth); swept the full journal (Jun 29 → Jul 17, 143k lines, zero errors since the 21:44 deploy); fixed `get_info()` advertising rmcp defaults; then shipped it end to end: PR #249 squash-merged to main, release binary built (12m16s, `labby 1.5.0`), deployed into the Incus container, verified live, and tagged `labby-incus-05eab05d68dc`.

## Sequence of Events

1. **Investigation and log sweep** — see prior session doc for full detail and evidence.
2. **Fix under bead lab-3o0sc** — `crates/labby/src/mcp/server.rs` `get_info()` sets `Implementation::new("labby", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))`; assertions added to `server_capabilities_advertise_list_changed_support`.
3. **Quick-push** — branch `fix/mcp-server-identity` cut from origin/main@05219b5f (v1.5.0 release); version bump + changelog skipped (release-please contract); session doc written and included; commit `91ae631f` pushed.
4. **Merge** — PR #249 squash-merged to main as `05eab05d`; branch deleted; local main fast-forwarded.
5. **Build** — `cargo build --workspace --all-features --release` finished clean in 12m16s producing `labby 1.5.0` (38,061,224 bytes).
6. **Deploy** — binary pushed to the `labby` Incus container as `/usr/local/bin/labby.new`, then stop → mv → chown/chmod → start; service `active` at 04:10:50 UTC with clean bootstrap and zero errors.
7. **Verify + tag** — live initialize returned `serverInfo {"name":"labby","version":"1.5.0"}`; lightweight tag `labby-incus-05eab05d68dc` pushed per deploy convention.
8. **This closeout** — maintenance pass + this doc landed on main (main had meanwhile gained #250/#252/#253 from work outside this session).

## Key Findings

- Summarized from the investigation (evidence in prior doc): connector failures were never server-side — claude.ai backend verified every OAuth attempt and served live quick-shell widget traffic minutes before each re-auth; remaining suspect is Claude Desktop connector UI state.
- Destructive-annotated widget callbacks execute WARN-only for non-elicitation clients (`destructive action elicitation not supported`, 392 since Jul 16) — flagged as a policy decision, unchanged.
- Five gateway upstreams remain `oauth_needs_reauth` (google-calendar/drive/gmail/people, globalping) — ~95% of journal warning volume.
- Deployed binary identity confirmed fixed: pre-deploy initialize returned `rmcp 2.1.0`; post-deploy returns `labby 1.5.0`.

## Technical Decisions

- Deploy method matched the observed convention (no deploy script exists): release build on devhost → `incus file push` to a temp name → stop/swap/start (avoids ETXTBSY on the running binary) → lightweight `labby-incus-<sha12>` tag.
- Branch cut from origin/main at the v1.5.0 release commit so `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` embeds 1.5.0 rather than stale 1.4.1.
- Second session doc created instead of amending the first — the first was already merged via PR #249, and post-push amendment is out of contract; this doc links it.

## Files Changed

| status | path | previous path | purpose | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| modified | `crates/labby/src/mcp/server.rs` | — | serverInfo identity fix + test assertions | merged in `05eab05d` (PR #249) |
| created | `docs/sessions/2026-07-16-labby-connector-investigation-and-server-identity-fix.md` | — | mid-session log (pre-merge metadata) | merged in `05eab05d` (PR #249) |
| created | `docs/sessions/2026-07-17-labby-server-identity-deploy-completion.md` | — | this closeout doc | this commit |

Out-of-repo: deployed `/usr/local/bin/labby` (1.5.0) inside the `labby` Incus container; agent memory `labby_incus_deployment.md` written under the project memory dir.

## Beads Activity

| bead | title | actions | final status | why it mattered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| lab-3o0sc | Set labby MCP serverInfo instead of rmcp default | created → claimed → closed (with verification evidence) | closed | Tracked the fix per repo workflow; shipped in PR #249 and deployed |

Observed but not touched: in-progress beads lab-0j6i8 (P1, gateway.reload TimeoutLayer cancellation — matches the external dirty files and commit `4dbe7d89`), lab-5vssx, lab-gf52l, lab-p8yxv — none are this session's work.

## Repository Maintenance

- **Plans**: `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` left in place — status still ambiguous (not clearly complete); no other plan candidates. Evidence: `Plans` injection lists only it and the already-archived OAuth proxy plan.
- **Beads**: no new bead actions needed at closeout; lab-3o0sc closed earlier in-session. `bd list --status=in_progress` reviewed — all four belong to other workstreams.
- **Worktrees/branches — all left alone, with reasons**:
  - Dirty working tree files `crates/labby-gateway/src/gateway/manager/tests/cleanup.rs` (+50) and `crates/labby-gateway/src/gateway/runtime.rs` (+8): external WIP for lab-0j6i8 (follow-up to `4dbe7d89`), not this session's — excluded via path-limited commit.
  - Codex worktrees (`agent/add-server-mcp-app`, `codex/mcp-ui-review-fixes`, one locked/initializing detached at `4dbe7d89`): owned by external codex agents, one actively initializing — hands off.
  - `/tmp/labby-gateway-status-1784281412` (`agent/gateway-status-mcp-app`, upstream gone) and local branch `fix/mcp-app-list-changed` (upstream gone): content appears squash-merged via #252/#253 (title match), but squash breaks ancestry proof and ownership is another agent's — listed as cleanup candidates for Jacob, not deleted.
  - `marketplace-no-mcp` (behind 18): protected long-lived variant branch per root CLAUDE.md — never auto-cleaned.
  - This session's `fix/mcp-server-identity`: already deleted by the merge flow (verified absent from branch list).
- **Stale docs**: prior session doc's "in flight" next-steps are superseded by this doc rather than amended (post-push amend rule). No other docs contradicted.
- **Sync**: local main fast-forwarded `4dbe7d89 → 01c2c4da` before committing (incoming #250/#252/#253 verified not to touch the dirty files).

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Shell (Bash)**: git/gh (branch, PR #249, squash-merge, tags), cargo (nextest, check, release build), incus (exec, file push/pull), journalctl pipelines, curl MCP handshakes, bd. Issues: none new this segment; dolt auto-backup i/o timeout warnings persist on every `bd` call (known edgehost flakiness).
- **File tools (Read/Write/Edit)**: fix + tests, session docs, agent memory.
- **Skills**: `vibin:quick-push` (full flow), `vibin:save-to-md` (twice — constrained mid-session, standalone now).
- **Background tasks**: release build ran backgrounded (`bpooaa7z0`), completed exit 0.
- **Session MCP tools**: `spawn_task`/`dismiss_task` for the serverInfo chip (superseded when fixed in-session).

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `gh pr create` / `gh pr merge 249 --squash --delete-branch` | merged as `05eab05d`, branch deleted |
| `cargo build --workspace --all-features --release` | clean, 12m16s, `labby 1.5.0` |
| `incus file push target/release/labby labby/usr/local/bin/labby.new --mode 0755` | pushed 38MB |
| `incus exec labby -- sh -c 'systemctl stop labby && mv … && systemctl start labby …'` | `active`, `labby 1.5.0` |
| live initialize via curl (in-container) | `serverInfo {"name":"labby","version":"1.5.0"}` |
| `git tag labby-incus-05eab05d68dc && git push origin …` | tag pushed |
| `git pull --ff-only` (closeout) | main `4dbe7d89 → 01c2c4da` |

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Live gateway MCP identity | `serverInfo: rmcp 2.1.0` | `serverInfo: labby 1.5.0` (verified on the running container) |
| Gateway uptime | running since Jul 16 21:44 build | restarted 04:10:50 UTC Jul 17 on the new binary; live MCP sessions dropped once (expected) |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo nextest run -p labby --all-features server_capabilities_advertise` | pass with identity assertions | 1 passed | pass |
| `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo check --all-targets --all-features` | clean | clean, 1m53s | pass |
| `./target/release/labby --version` | `labby 1.5.0` | `labby 1.5.0` | pass |
| `incus exec labby -- systemctl is-active labby` (post-swap) | `active` | `active` | pass |
| live initialize `serverInfo` | `labby` / `1.5.0` | `{"name":"labby","version":"1.5.0"}` | pass |
| startup journal grep (3 min window) | no ERROR | clean bootstrap lines only | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- Deploy rollback: rebuild any prior commit (or reuse a release artifact) and repeat the push/swap; deploy tags mark exact binaries (`labby-incus-05219b5ff05f` = previous).
- The restart dropped live MCP sessions — claude.ai/ChatGPT clients re-initialize on next use; no further action needed.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not delete `fix/mcp-app-list-changed` or the `/tmp` gateway-status worktree despite gone upstreams — squash-merge breaks ancestry proof and both belong to external agent workflows.
- Did not amend the first session doc post-merge (contract) — superseded by this one.

## Open Questions

- Claude Desktop connector UI: does claude.ai web show the dinglebear connector Connected while Desktop shows nothing? (Client-side; unverifiable from the server.)
- Destructive widget-callback policy: is WARN-only execution for non-elicitation clients (e.g. `write_quick_shell_input`) intended?
- `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` — active or abandoned?

## Next Steps

1. Re-authorize the five expired gateway upstreams (google-calendar/drive/gmail/people, globalping) to eliminate the dominant warning spam.
2. Retest the Claude Desktop connector (full quit + relaunch; compare claude.ai web connector state; remove duplicate entries) — it will now show the `labby` identity.
3. Decide the destructive widget-callback elicitation policy (Open Questions).
4. External WIP continues elsewhere: lab-0j6i8 dirty files in this tree belong to that workstream — do not sweep them into unrelated commits.
5. Cleanup candidates for Jacob when convenient: local branch `fix/mcp-app-list-changed`, `/tmp/labby-gateway-status-1784281412` worktree + `agent/gateway-status-mcp-app` branch (upstreams gone, content squash-merged via #252/#253).
