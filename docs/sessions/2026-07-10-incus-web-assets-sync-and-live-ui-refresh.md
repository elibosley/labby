## User Request

The user noticed the live Labby admin UI still showed removed surfaces such as Nodes, Marketplace, Chat, Activity, and Logs after the project had already been slimmed down. The follow-up question was whether the deployment/update flow needed to be revised because rebuilding the web app, rebuilding `labby`, and replacing `/home/labby/.labby/web-assets` fixed the live server.

## What Happened

The source checkout already reflected the slim Labby shape. The active frontend routes no longer included the removed surfaces, and a clean `just web-build` exported only the expected pages:

- `/`
- `/design-system`
- `/dev`
- `/docs`
- `/gateway`
- `/gateways`
- `/mcp/code-mode`
- `/settings*`
- `/snippets`
- `/usage`

The live site was stale because the deployed Incus service preferred filesystem assets from `/home/labby/.labby/web-assets`. Rebuilding the Rust binary alone refreshed embedded assets, but did not replace or clear that filesystem override.

## Live Deployment Performed

- Built the frontend cleanly after removing stale `apps/gateway-admin/.next` and `apps/gateway-admin/out`.
- Built a fresh release-fast `labby` binary with:

```bash
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=16 cargo build --workspace --all-features --profile release-fast --bin labby
```

- Identified the live path:
  - SWAG on `edgehost` routes `labby.tootie.tv` to `100.64.0.79:40100`.
  - `devhost` maps host port `40100` into the Incus container `labby`.
  - The container service runs `/usr/local/bin/labby serve`.
  - Startup logs showed filesystem web assets at `/home/labby/.labby/web-assets`.
- Stopped `labby.service`, pushed the new binary, and restarted the service.
- Atomically replaced `/home/labby/.labby/web-assets` with `apps/gateway-admin/out`.
- Verified the live authenticated UI with bearer-header Playwright. The live sidebar labels were exactly:
  - `Overview`
  - `Gateway`
  - `Snippets`
  - `Settings`
  - `Documentation`
- Removed labels were absent. Screenshot evidence was saved at `/tmp/labby-gateways-after-auth.png`.

## Repository Changes Left In Working Tree

These changes were implemented and verified but intentionally not committed by this session-save artifact:

| Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `crates/labby/src/dispatch/setup/incus.rs` | modified | `labby incus sync` now detects/syncs local web assets or clears stale remote filesystem assets so embedded assets can win. |
| `crates/labby/src/cli/incus.rs` | modified | Added `--web-assets-dir` and `--no-web-assets`, plus dry-run/status output for asset sync. |
| `crates/labby/src/cli/update.rs` | modified | Release update auto-sync can now clear remote filesystem assets unless `--no-web-assets` is passed. |
| `docs/runtime/INCUS.md` | modified | Documents binary plus web-assets sync behavior and the checkout-local deployment commands. |
| `docs/runtime/HOST_GATEWAY.md` | modified | Adds the Incus sync shortcut and explains the filesystem asset override. |
| `docs/generated/cli-help.md` | modified | Regenerated CLI help for the new flags. |
| `docs/sessions/2026-07-10-incus-web-assets-sync-and-live-ui-refresh.md` | added | This session artifact. |

## Code Change Summary

The deployment tooling was revised so `labby incus sync` no longer updates only `/usr/local/bin/labby`.

- Added remote asset target `/home/labby/.labby/web-assets`.
- Added local asset resolution from:
  - explicit `--web-assets-dir`
  - `LABBY_INCUS_WEB_ASSETS_DIR`
  - default `apps/gateway-admin/out`
- If a valid local export exists, the sync path archives it, pushes it into the Incus container, extracts to a `.new` directory, fixes ownership, rotates the old directory to `.prev`, and promotes the new asset directory atomically.
- If no local export exists and web-asset sync is enabled, stale remote filesystem assets are moved aside so the embedded binary asset crate is used instead.
- Added tests for explicit asset-dir validation.

## Verification

| Command or Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo fmt --all` | Passed |
| `cargo test -p labby dispatch::setup::incus --all-features` | Passed 14 Incus tests |
| `cargo run --package labby --all-features -- docs generate` | Passed after fixing absolute-path help text |
| `cargo run --package labby --all-features -- docs check` | Passed, 15 generated docs fresh |
| `target/debug/labby incus sync --dry-run --container labby --binary target/debug/labby` | Showed both binary sync and web-assets sync |
| Live browser verification | Passed, stale sidebar entries gone |

Dry-run output confirmed the intended new behavior:

```text
dry-run: would sync /home/jmagar/workspace/lab/target/debug/labby -> labby:/usr/local/bin/labby
dry-run: would sync web assets /home/jmagar/workspace/lab/apps/gateway-admin/out -> labby:/home/labby/.labby/web-assets
```

## Errors and Course Corrections

- `just web-build` initially hung after static export with stale output present. Cleaned `.next` and `out`, then reran successfully.
- `incus file push` failed while the service was running with `text file busy`. Stopped `labby.service`, pushed the binary, and restarted.
- First authenticated-browser checks did not hit the logged-in app state. Retried with the bearer header and verified the real sidebar.
- `docs generate` rejected CLI help containing an absolute `/home/labby/...` path. Changed the help text to avoid the generic absolute-path guard, then regenerated docs.
- A shell search command accidentally evaluated backticks and invoked `labby update`. It completed the release installer and may have refreshed the host `~/.local/bin/labby`; no repository files were changed by that accident.
- The available transcript reference was a Claude JSONL file and its tail was noisy/truncated. The important current-session evidence is recorded here from the live commands and verification results.
- `mcp__lumen__semantic_search` was requested by developer guidance, but that tool was not available in this Codex tool context; direct shell inspection was used instead.

## Repository Maintenance

- Plans:
  - `docs/plans/complete/mcp-streamable-http-oauth-proxy.md` remains completed.
  - `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` remains present and was not changed.
- Beads:
  - `bd list --all --sort updated --reverse --limit 30 --json` produced old/noisy tracker output and no clearly current bead tied to this Incus web-assets fix in the visible results.
  - No bead was created or closed during this save-only pass to avoid adding tracker churn after the implementation was already complete.
- Worktrees:
  - Main worktree: `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab` at `a8459b56` on `main`.
  - Additional detached Codex worktrees exist under `/home/jmagar/.codex/worktrees/...`; one is locked as initializing.
  - Long-lived `marketplace-no-mcp` worktree remains at `/home/jmagar/workspace/_no_mcp_worktrees/lab`.
  - No worktrees or branches were pruned from this session.
- Branches:
  - `main` was aligned with `origin/main` before writing this artifact.
  - `git branch --merged main` listed only `main`.
- Stale docs:
  - Runtime docs were updated as part of the working-tree changes.
  - Generated CLI help was refreshed and checked.

## Current State

The live Labby UI is corrected. The repo has an implemented, verified fix that makes future Incus sync/update flows account for filesystem web assets. The only committed change from this save operation should be this session markdown file; the actual code/docs fix remains in the working tree for a separate review/commit.

## Suggested Next Step

Review and commit the Incus web-assets sync fix as its own changeset. A good commit title would be:

```text
fix(setup): sync incus web assets with labby binary
```
