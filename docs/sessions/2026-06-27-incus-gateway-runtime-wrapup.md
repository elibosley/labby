# Incus gateway runtime wrap-up

## User Request

Jacob asked whether Lab had YAML for building the Incus container, then pushed on the design until the Incus docs and the `incus-codex-jail` article were reviewed. He then requested a quick push, `git add .`, and PR creation for the full dirty tree.

## Session Overview

The session established that Lab currently has an Incus bootstrap script and docs, but no Incus-native YAML artifact set yet. The Incus docs and the referenced article point toward native Incus YAML for ACLs, bridge networking, profiles, instance config, cloud-init, device mounts, and optional nested runtime support. The article was scraped into a local reference file for future design work.

For wrap-up, the repo was moved from `main` to `codex/incus-gateway-runtime-wrapup`, the workspace version was bumped from `0.27.0` to `0.28.0`, and `cargo check` passed.

## Sequence of Events

1. Checked the live repo for Incus-related files and found `scripts/incus-bootstrap.sh`, `docs/runtime/INCUS.md`, and Docker compose files.
2. Compared the bash-driven bootstrap with Incus docs and revised the recommendation toward Incus-native YAML artifacts.
3. Reviewed AppArmor-related Incus options and noted that `raw.apparmor` or `raw.lxc` are the documented escape hatches, but should not be defaulted casually.
4. Scraped `https://weisser-zwerg.dev/posts/incus-codex-jail/` into `docs/references/incus-codex-jail.md` and reviewed the full saved markdown.
5. Audited the dirty working tree and found a broad pre-existing mixed change set on `main`.
6. Started quick-push closeout: created `codex/incus-gateway-runtime-wrapup`, bumped version files, updated `CHANGELOG.md`, and ran `cargo check`.

## Key Findings

- `scripts/incus-bootstrap.sh` is currently the imperative Incus bootstrap entrypoint.
- `docs/runtime/INCUS.md` is already present as an untracked Incus runbook and points to Ubuntu 24.04, amd64, privileged container, `/dev/net/tun`, and `labby setup --provision`.
- Incus supports native YAML flows for profile and instance configuration; the better next implementation would add Incus-native artifacts rather than invent a custom YAML dialect.
- The referenced article's strongest patterns are dedicated agent bridge network, network ACL YAML, reusable profile YAML, idmapped workspace disk mount, and helper functions that repoint the workspace to the current host directory.
- The article's recursive profile pattern supports nested Docker/Incus with `security.nesting`, syscall interception, kernel module preloading, and in-container preseed.

## Technical Decisions

- Version bump type: minor, `0.27.0` to `0.28.0`, because the dirty tree includes new self-hosting/runtime capability and documentation for the Incus gateway path.
- `config/acp-adapters.package.json` was not bumped because it is versioned as `0.0.0`, which quick-push treats as not yet versioned.
- Historical `0.27.0` mentions in changelog, third-party docs references, and dependency lock entries were left unchanged.
- The scraped article was committed as a reference artifact rather than a source-of-truth runbook.

## Files Changed

The working tree contained 160 dirty paths before this session's save file was added. The main groups observed were:

| status | path or group | purpose | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| created | `docs/references/incus-codex-jail.md` | local markdown snapshot of the referenced article | full scrape saved and reviewed |
| created | `docs/runtime/INCUS.md` | Incus deployment runbook already present before scrape | `git status --short` showed it untracked |
| modified | `scripts/incus-bootstrap.sh` | Incus bootstrap substrate validation and Tailscale auth handling | diff showed Ubuntu/amd64 checks and TUN validation |
| modified | `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/runtime/HOST_GATEWAY.md`, `docs/README.md` | shift runtime guidance toward Incus and system service flow | diff showed Incus primary deployment wording |
| modified | `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `apps/gateway-admin/package.json`, `CHANGELOG.md` | version bump to `0.28.0` | `cargo check` compiled workspace crates as `0.28.0` |
| modified | `crates/labby/src/dispatch/setup/host_service.rs` | host service command capture/redaction changes | diff showed capped output and redaction helpers |
| modified | `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-table.tsx` | gateway disable confirmation UI | diff showed `ActionConfirmationDialog` |
| modified | many docs/session/plan files | broad hostname/wording cleanup already present in the checkout | status and representative diffs showed renames and anonymized names |
| renamed | `docs/sessions/2026-05-31-agent-os-skill-overhaul-and-plugin.md` | rename to workstation wording | `git status --short` showed `RM` |
| renamed | `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-12-backuphost-live-test-services.md` | rename to backup-node wording | `git status --short` showed `RM` |
| renamed | `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-12-backuphost-live-test-services-design.md` | rename to backup-node wording | `git status --short` showed `RM` |

## Beads Activity

No bead activity observed during this closeout. No bead changes were made because the user requested a quick push of the current worktree.

## Repository Maintenance

- Plans: no plan files were moved. Quick-push scope was constrained to documenting and committing the current dirty tree.
- Beads: no bead reads or writes changed tracker state.
- Worktrees/branches: current checkout was on `main`; a new branch `codex/incus-gateway-runtime-wrapup` was created before version edits.
- Stale docs: no stale-doc sweep was attempted beyond the already dirty documentation changes; broad cleanup is already represented in the working tree.
- Transparency: the dirty tree was not created by this session except for the scraped article and this session note; the rest pre-existed before the quick-push request.

## Tools and Skills Used

- Skills: `vibin:quick-push` and `vibin:save-to-md` instructions were used for the closeout workflow.
- Shell commands: used for git status/diff/log, version discovery, branch creation, article scraping, and `cargo check`.
- Web/docs: official Incus docs were reviewed through browser search/open; the `incus-codex-jail` article was fetched with `curl` and converted to markdown.
- File edits: used patch-based edits for changelog and this session note; mechanical version edits updated manifest files.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `git status --short` | showed 160 dirty paths before session note |
| `git switch -c codex/incus-gateway-runtime-wrapup` | created and switched to the feature branch |
| `cargo check` | passed; workspace crates compiled as `0.28.0` |
| `git grep -F "0.27.0" -- '*.toml' '*.json' '*.md' '*.yml' '*.yaml'` | remaining hits were historical changelog/dependency/reference entries |
| `curl -L --fail https://weisser-zwerg.dev/posts/incus-codex-jail/` | fetched article content successfully |

## Errors Encountered

- `mcp__lumen__semantic_search` was requested by developer instruction but was not exposed as a callable tool in this session, so repo discovery used shell commands.
- `pandoc`, `lynx`, `w3m`, and `html2text` were unavailable, so the article was converted with a small local standard-library HTML parser.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| version | workspace and gateway-admin package at `0.27.0` | bumped to `0.28.0` |
| Incus reference material | article not present locally | article snapshot saved under `docs/references/` |
| git branch | dirty worktree on `main` | dirty worktree moved to `codex/incus-gateway-runtime-wrapup` |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo check` | workspace check passes after version bump | finished successfully in dev profile | pass |
| old-version scan | no current project version files left at `0.27.0` | only historical/dependency/reference hits remained | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: the commit is intentionally broad because the user requested `git add .`; review should expect mixed pre-existing work streams.
- Risk: `docs/references/incus-codex-jail.md` is a scraped third-party article snapshot and should remain reference material, not project policy.
- Rollback: revert the final feature commit or close the PR without merge; the branch isolates the dirty tree from `main`.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not implement Incus YAML artifacts yet; this session stopped at research/reference capture and push closeout.
- Did not default AppArmor to unconfined; the docs review suggested keeping that as an explicit escape hatch until the workload proves it needs it.

## Open Questions

- Should Labby adopt the article's unprivileged recursive profile pattern instead of the current privileged Ubuntu 24.04 container model?
- Should the final artifact set include project/network/preseed YAML in addition to profile and instance YAML?
- Which of the broad pre-existing docs/session rename changes should remain in the PR versus be split later?

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push this session note alone.
2. Stage the full worktree with `git add .`, commit with co-authorship, and push.
3. Create a PR for `codex/incus-gateway-runtime-wrapup`.
4. In review, decide whether to split the broad dirty tree into smaller follow-up branches or merge as one operational cleanup.
