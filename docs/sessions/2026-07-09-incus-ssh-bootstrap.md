# Incus SSH Bootstrap Session

## User Request

Build a CLI command that generates an `id_ed25519` SSH key inside the Incus container, reads the user's `~/.ssh/config`, ignores any hosts with `github` in them, and exchanges that container key with every host the Incus host can already access passwordlessly. Then test it live so the container can reach the user's devices. After follow-up review, implement the non-personal hardening suggestions, remove any personal-device-specific behavior, and merge the work into `main`.

The final turn asked to save this session to markdown with repository maintenance evidence.

## Session Overview

Implemented and merged `labby setup incus-ssh bootstrap` and `labby setup incus-ssh verify` on `main`.

The shipped feature is generic: it parses concrete SSH config host entries, skips wildcard and GitHub-like hosts, supports include/exclude filters, generates a container key idempotently, appends that public key to reachable hosts with duplicate guards, installs a sanitized SSH config in the container when appropriate, and verifies passwordless container access. It reports structured JSON fields for authorized, failed, and skipped targets.

The session included live bootstrap work against the operator's environment. A transient device-specific Windows OpenSSH workaround was implemented during exploration, then removed after the user clarified that no personal-device-specific logic belongs in code.

## Sequence Of Events

1. Created bead `lab-zmku8` for the initial Incus SSH trust bootstrap command.
2. Added `setup incus-ssh bootstrap` CLI plumbing in `crates/labby/src/cli/setup.rs`.
3. Added Incus SSH planning, config parsing, container key generation, public-key extraction, and remote `authorized_keys` append logic in `crates/labby/src/dispatch/setup/incus.rs`.
4. Added GitHub filtering for both host aliases and `HostName` values.
5. Ran dry-run and live bootstrap attempts. Fixed Incus user execution by using `su - labby -c` inside the container rather than `incus exec --user labby`.
6. Added `BatchMode=yes` and SSH connection timeout handling after a live run hung on an unreachable target.
7. Changed behavior to continue after failed hosts by default and collect failures instead of aborting the whole bootstrap.
8. Created bead `lab-s449d` for the broader UX hardening pass.
9. Added include/exclude filters, `--fail-fast`, `--continue-on-error`, structured JSON outcomes, sanitized container SSH config install, and a `verify` subcommand.
10. Removed a transient personal-device-specific Windows admin OpenSSH special case after user correction.
11. Replaced personal hostnames and IPs in tests with neutral examples.
12. Added generic refinements: configurable `--timeout-seconds`, docs in `docs/runtime/HOST_GATEWAY.md`, and `scripts/check-incus-ssh`.
13. Committed the feature as `feat(setup): bootstrap incus ssh trust`, rebased onto `origin/main`, verified, and pushed `main`.
14. Added a corrective bead comment to `lab-s449d` noting that the final pushed code removed the transient personal-device-specific handling.

## Key Findings

- Incus `exec --user labby` expects a numeric UID in this environment; running a login shell via `su - labby -c` inside the container works for user-scoped SSH commands.
- Live SSH bootstrap must force non-interactive behavior. Without `BatchMode=yes` and a connection timeout, unreachable hosts can hang the command.
- The bootstrap should be useful even when one configured host is down. The default shipped behavior continues and reports failures; `--fail-fast` restores abort-on-first-failure semantics.
- Installing a sanitized container SSH config is useful for full fleet bootstraps, but filtered runs should avoid overwriting the container config unless explicitly requested.
- Tests and docs must use neutral sample hosts. Real hostnames, Tailscale names, and IPs do not belong in product code or fixtures.

## Technical Decisions

- Keep all implementation local to setup/Incus surfaces instead of creating a new runtime service.
- Preserve the existing Rust module style: no `mod.rs`, no business logic in CLI adapters beyond argument mapping and output.
- Parse the user's SSH config conservatively: concrete `Host` aliases only, skip wildcard/pattern entries, and honor basic `HostName`, `User`, and `Port`.
- Treat host aliases or hostnames containing `github` case-insensitively as skipped targets.
- Default to a dry-run unless `--yes` is passed.
- Use generic SSH behavior only. No personal hostnames, device aliases, or platform-specific operator shortcuts are encoded in final code.

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/labby/src/cli/setup.rs` | Added `setup incus-ssh bootstrap` and `setup incus-ssh verify` argument surfaces, summaries, JSON output, and validation. |
| `crates/labby/src/dispatch/setup/incus.rs` | Added SSH config parsing, bootstrap planning, Incus command execution, key generation, authorization, config install, verification, and focused tests. |
| `docs/runtime/HOST_GATEWAY.md` | Documented container SSH trust bootstrap and verification commands. |
| `scripts/check-incus-ssh` | Added a small JSON-based verification helper for CI/operator checks. |

## Beads Activity

| Bead | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| `lab-zmku8` | Created, claimed, implemented, and closed for the initial bootstrap command. |
| `lab-s449d` | Created, claimed, implemented, and closed for UX hardening. Added a corrective comment after close because its original close reason mentioned a transient personal-device-specific implementation that was removed before final push. |

## Repository Maintenance

- Checked `git status --short --branch` after pushing the feature: `main` was clean and aligned with `origin/main`.
- Checked recent history with `git log --oneline -5`; feature commit was at `c9d8e42c` after rebase and push.
- Checked the feature commit file list with `git show --name-only --format=short HEAD`; only the two Rust files, one runtime doc, and one script were included.
- Checked worktrees with `git worktree list --porcelain`. Detached Codex worktrees and the long-lived `marketplace-no-mcp` worktree were left untouched because ownership and purpose are explicit or unclear.
- Checked branches with `git branch -vv`. `marketplace-no-mcp` is intentionally long-lived per repo instructions, so no cleanup was performed.
- Checked plans under `docs/plans`. `docs/plans/complete/mcp-streamable-http-oauth-proxy.md` was already complete; `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` was not clearly part of this task and was left in place.
- Checked `gh pr view --json number,title,url`; no active PR existed for the current branch.
- Confirmed `.claude/current-plan` did not contain an active plan.
- Found a transcript path for this checkout, but it appeared to be an older or different Claude session; the current session artifact relies on live repository evidence and the conversation state.

## Tools And Skills Used

- `vibin:save-to-md` for this session artifact workflow.
- `bd` for bead creation, claiming, closing, and the final corrective comment.
- `git` for status, history, rebase, commit, push, and maintenance checks.
- `cargo` and `just`-adjacent Rust commands for focused verification.
- `incus` and `ssh` during live bootstrap testing.
- Local shell search and file reads for repository discovery. The session instructions referenced Lumen semantic search, but that tool was not available in the exposed tool set, so local repository inspection was used.

## Commands Executed

| Command | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `bd create ...` / `bd update ... --claim` / `bd close ...` | Created, claimed, and closed `lab-zmku8` and `lab-s449d`. |
| `cargo test -p labby setup::incus --all-features` | Passed 12 focused tests. |
| `cargo check -p labby --all-features` | Passed after implementation and after rebase. |
| `cargo run -p labby --all-features -- --json setup incus-ssh bootstrap --dry-run --include ...` | Verified filtered dry-run behavior and config-install defaults. |
| `cargo run -p labby --all-features -- --json setup incus-ssh bootstrap --dry-run --include ... --install-config` | Verified explicit config-install dry-run behavior. |
| `grep -RInE 'agent-os|devhost|edgehost|nashost|backuphost|laptophost|winhost|100\\.109|100\\.120|10\\.1\\.0\\.1|tower' ...` | Returned no output after neutralizing tests and removing personal-specific code. |
| `git pull --rebase origin main` | Rebased the feature commit successfully. |
| `git push` | Pushed `main` with feature commit `c9d8e42c`. |
| `bd comment lab-s449d ... --json` | Added a correction note documenting the final removal of personal-device-specific behavior. |

## Errors Encountered

- A first Cargo test command attempted multiple test filters in one invocation; reran the focused module test successfully.
- Live Incus command execution initially failed because `incus exec --user labby` did not accept the username form used; switched to `su - labby -c`.
- A live SSH run hung on an unreachable target; added `BatchMode=yes` and configurable connection timeout handling.
- One configured host timed out during live testing. The shipped command records such failures and continues by default.
- A transient Windows admin OpenSSH workaround was explored and later removed because it encoded personal environment knowledge.
- Cargo lock contention occurred while overlapping build/test commands were running; reran verification cleanly.

## Behavior Changes

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| No setup command existed to seed container SSH trust. | `labby setup incus-ssh bootstrap` plans or performs container key generation and host authorization. |
| No container-side verification existed. | `labby setup incus-ssh verify` checks passwordless SSH from inside the container. |
| A single unreachable host could hang or derail a run. | SSH calls use batch mode and configurable timeouts; failures are collected unless `--fail-fast` is set. |
| Filtered runs risked writing a partial SSH config into the container. | Filtered runs skip config install by default unless `--install-config` is passed. |
| Early test fixtures included real device names during exploration. | Final fixtures and code use neutral hostnames and example IP ranges. |

## Verification Evidence

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Focused tests | `cargo test -p labby setup::incus --all-features` passed 12 tests. |
| All-feature compile | `cargo check -p labby --all-features` passed. |
| Dry-run UX | Filtered dry-run omitted config install by default; explicit `--install-config` showed the install step. |
| Personal-data sweep | Targeted grep over changed files returned no personal hostnames or listed IP patterns. |
| Live bootstrap | Earlier live run authorized reachable configured targets from the container and reported one timeout. |
| Post-rebase verification | Focused tests and all-feature check passed after rebasing onto `origin/main`. |
| Push | `main` pushed to `origin` at `c9d8e42c`. |

## Risks And Rollback

- Risk: the SSH config parser intentionally handles a conservative subset of OpenSSH config. Complex `Include`, `Match`, or computed configuration may not be represented.
- Risk: bootstrap mutates remote `authorized_keys` files when run with `--yes`.
- Risk: container config installation overwrites the managed container SSH config path after making a backup.
- Rollback: revert commit `c9d8e42c`, remove the generated container key and config under `/home/labby/.ssh/`, and remove the container public key line from affected remote `authorized_keys` files.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not keep any personal device or operator-specific special cases in product code.
- Did not delete detached Codex worktrees or long-lived branches.
- Did not broaden this into a general-purpose SSH config parser beyond the current bootstrap need.
- Did not expose this provisioning flow through MCP, HTTP, or remote admin surfaces.

- Runtime docs: `docs/runtime/HOST_GATEWAY.md`
- Verification helper: `scripts/check-incus-ssh`

## Open Questions

- Whether future support should recursively resolve OpenSSH `Include` directives or shell out to `ssh -G` per target for fully expanded config.
- Whether the container config install path should gain a restore command for the automatic backup file.
- Whether this should eventually support a generic authorized-keys removal command for rollback.

## Next Steps

1. Use `labby setup incus-ssh verify --json` or `scripts/check-incus-ssh` as the recurring health check.
2. If more SSH config edge cases appear, add parser tests using neutral fixture data before expanding behavior.
3. Consider a generic rollback helper that removes the exact generated public key from selected hosts.
