# Codex OAuth callback relay session

## User Request

The user reported that Labby/Codex MCP OAuth was still opening a browser to a
loopback callback URL such as `127.0.0.1:7686/callback/...`, asked how to make
the flow automatic for the Codex/ChatGPT desktop app, and then asked for durable
relay documentation plus a deeper SSH inspection of the relay on `edgehost`.

## Session Overview

The session diagnosed the loopback redirect as a Codex client registration issue,
not a Labby server-side OAuth issue. The winhost Windows Codex config was updated
to use the public callback relay, a `winhost` relay target was registered on
`edgehost`, the user confirmed authentication succeeded, and relay documentation
was written and expanded under `~/docs`.

## Sequence of Events

1. Investigated the failed browser tab and the OAuth redirect URI that pointed
   to `http://127.0.0.1:7686/callback/EWtlD9o7HXkd`.
2. Confirmed live Labby metadata advertised the native callback relay endpoints
   and that the failing loopback URI had been registered by the client.
3. Checked winhost Windows Codex config through WSL at
   `/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex/config.toml` and found the Labby MCP server entry
   existed, but `mcp_oauth_callback_url` and `mcp_oauth_callback_port` were
   absent.
4. Registered `winhost` in the callback relay registry and patched winhost's Codex
   config to use `https://callback.tootie.tv/callback/winhost` on port `38935`.
5. Created the Codex callback relay doc in `~/docs/dev/`, removed dotfile-sync
   content after the user clarified scope, and captured each revision through
   chezmoi.
6. SSH'd into `edgehost` and inspected the relay container, Compose files, SWAG
   vhost, Docker network, registry, route source, health endpoints, and recent
   logs.
7. Used `vibin:save-to-md` to capture this session as an in-repo session log.

## Key Findings

- Codex must set `mcp_oauth_callback_url` and
  `mcp_oauth_callback_port`; otherwise it can register a browser-local loopback
  redirect. The relay doc now records this at
  `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md:10`.
- winhost Windows Codex must use the `winhost` relay target, not `winhost-wsl`,
  because the Windows app and browser run in the Windows host namespace. See
  `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md:20` and
  `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md:238`.
- The relay's public path is `callback.tootie.tv`, proxied by SWAG on `edgehost`
  to `callback-relay:39001`. See
  `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md:87`.
- The live registry has targets for `devhost`, `backuphost`, `edgehost`, `winhost`,
  `winhost-wsl`, `nashost`, and `laptophost-wsl`. See
  `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md:107`.
- The relay container is from Compose project `mcp-oauth-gateway`, runs
  `python /app/scripts/callback_relay_server.py` as `authuser`, and uses
  Docker network `jakenet`. See
  `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md:140`.
- The Docker image still reports an inherited `8000/tcp` exposed port, but the
  actual Uvicorn listener is `39001`. See
  `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md:161`.
- Relay source confirms `GET/POST /callback/{machine}/{suffix...}` and
  admin-only `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/machines/{machine}` routes. See
  `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md:187`.

## Technical Decisions

- The Windows desktop app was configured with the Windows Tailscale IP target
  (`100.99.0.5`) because the callback listener belongs to the Windows Codex
  process, not WSL.
- The relay registry was updated through its admin API from inside the
  `callback-relay` container, pulling `CALLBACK_RELAY_ADMIN_TOKEN` from
  `/proc/1/environ` so the token was never printed into chat or docs.
- Dotfile sync notes were intentionally removed from the Codex relay doc after
  the user clarified that the document should only cover the relay and Codex
  OAuth flow.
- No broad repo cleanup was performed; the current Lab checkout had unrelated
  dirty Code Mode files, and the session work was external infrastructure/docs
  plus this generated session artifact.

## Beads Activity

No bead activity observed for this Codex relay session. `bd list` and
`.beads/interactions.jsonl` were inspected as required by the save workflow, but
recent beads such as `lab-5vssx` and `lab-semog` were unrelated release/Code
Mode work. No bead was created, edited, claimed, assigned, commented on, or
closed for the relay documentation session.

## Repository Maintenance

### Plans

`find docs/plans -maxdepth 2 -type f` showed
`docs/plans/complete/mcp-streamable-http-oauth-proxy.md` already under
`complete/` and `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` still open/active. No
plan files were moved.

### Beads

`bd list --all --sort updated --reverse --limit 40 --json` and
`tail -80 .beads/interactions.jsonl` were run. The observed bead activity was
unrelated to this relay work, so no tracker mutation was made.

### Worktrees and branches

`git worktree list --porcelain`, `git branch -vv`, and `git branch -r -vv`
showed only the main worktree and the intentional long-lived
`marketplace-no-mcp` worktree/branch. No worktree or branch cleanup was safe or
needed.

### Stale docs

The stale-doc pass was focused on the document contradicted by the live relay
inspection: `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md`. It was
updated with the full registry, Compose source, runtime network, health checks,
and route behavior. The doc was also checked to ensure dotfile-sync content did
not leak back into the relay doc.

### Dirty worktree

`git status --short --branch` showed pre-existing dirty Lab files under
`apps/gateway-admin/`, `crates/labby-codemode/`, `crates/labby-gateway/`, and
`crates/labby/src/mcp/`. They were left untouched and will not be included in
the session artifact commit.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Skills.** `vibin:homelab-map` was used for named-host routing context, and
  `vibin:save-to-md` was used for this session artifact.
- **Shell and SSH.** Used local shell commands plus `ssh edgehost` to inspect
  SWAG config, Docker state, relay source, registry, health endpoints, and logs.
- **File tools.** Used `apply_patch` to create this session file and update the
  relay doc during the session.
- **Chezmoi.** Used `chezmoi add`/`chezmoi re-add` behavior to capture the
  `~/docs` relay document into the dotfiles repo and auto-push it.
- **Web search.** Used web search for the separate dotfile-sync question, then
  kept those findings out of the relay doc after the user clarified scope.
- **External CLIs.** Used `git`, `gh`, `bd`, `docker`, `curl`, `jq`, `grep`,
  `sed`, `nl`, and `chezmoi`.
- **MCP servers/tools.** No MCP server call was used for the final `edgehost`
  relay inspection; the relay facts came from direct SSH and container reads.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `grep -nE '^(mcp_oauth_callback_url|mcp_oauth_callback_port)\b' /mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex/config.toml` | Initially found no callback override keys in winhost Windows Codex config. |
| `ssh edgehost 'docker ps --filter name=callback-relay --format ...'` | Confirmed `callback-relay` was running and healthy. |
| `ssh edgehost 'sed -n "1,220p" /mnt/appdata/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/callback.subdomain.conf'` | Confirmed SWAG proxies `callback.*` to `callback-relay:39001`. |
| `ssh edgehost 'docker exec callback-relay python -m json.tool /app/.cache/callback-relay/registry.json'` | Confirmed registered targets for devhost, backuphost, edgehost, winhost, winhost-wsl, nashost, and laptophost-wsl. |
| `ssh edgehost 'docker inspect callback-relay ...'` | Confirmed Compose project, command, user, mount, network, health, and environment key names. |
| `ssh edgehost 'docker exec callback-relay sed -n "1,290p" /app/scripts/callback_relay.py'` | Confirmed health, admin, and callback route behavior in the relay source. |
| `curl -k -sS -D - https://callback.tootie.tv/healthz -o -` | Public relay health returned HTTP 200 with `{"status":"ok"}`. |
| `chezmoi re-add /home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md` | Captured and pushed relay doc revisions to dotfiles as `e6d5c61` and `6f8ab6a`. |
| `grep -nEi 'dotfile sync|chezmoi|mise|...' /home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md` | Returned no output after cleanup, verifying the relay doc stayed relay-only. |

## Errors Encountered

- **Loopback callback timeout.** Browser opened
  `127.0.0.1:7686/callback/...` and timed out. Root cause: Codex registered a
  loopback redirect because the runtime config lacked `mcp_oauth_callback_url`.
  Resolution: configure winhost Windows Codex to use the public callback relay.
- **Wrong product assumption.** The issue was initially framed around Labby auth
  in general, then clarified as the Codex/ChatGPT desktop app rather than
  Gemini. Resolution: checked the Windows Codex config under
  `/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex/config.toml`.
- **Doc scope drift.** The first relay doc included dotfile-sync notes after the
  user had asked a separate sync question. Resolution: removed that content and
  verified with grep before recapturing via chezmoi.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| winhost Windows Codex OAuth | Codex could register `http://127.0.0.1:<random>/callback/...`, leading to a dead browser tab. | Codex config points at `https://callback.tootie.tv/callback/winhost` and local port `38935`. |
| Relay registry | Registry did not have the `winhost` Windows-host target confirmed for this app. | `winhost` maps to `http://100.99.0.5:38935/callback/winhost`. |
| Operator documentation | Relay details were scattered across chat/runtime inspection. | `/home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md` documents the flow, registry, routes, Compose source, and verification commands. |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `curl -k -sS -D - https://callback.tootie.tv/healthz -o -` | HTTP 200 from public relay health. | HTTP 200 with `{"status":"ok"}`. | pass |
| `ssh edgehost 'docker exec callback-relay sh -lc "curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:${CALLBACK_RELAY_PORT:-39001}/healthz"'` | Internal relay health returns ok. | `{"status":"ok"}`. | pass |
| `ssh edgehost 'docker exec callback-relay python -m json.tool /app/.cache/callback-relay/registry.json'` | Registry includes `winhost`. | `winhost` target was `http://100.99.0.5:38935/callback/winhost`. | pass |
| `grep -nEi 'dotfile sync|chezmoi|mise|...' /home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md` | No dotfile-sync terms in the relay doc. | No output. | pass |
| `chezmoi status /home/jmagar/docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md` | No unmanaged diff after capture. | No output. | pass |
| `chezmoi git -- log -1 --oneline -- docs/dev/private_codex-oauth-callback-relay.md` | Latest dotfiles commit reflects relay doc update. | `6f8ab6a Update docs/dev/codex-oauth-callback-relay.md`. | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- winhost Windows Codex config is machine-specific. Roll back by restoring
  `/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex/config.toml.bak.20260712T230620Z-oauth-callback`.
- The relay registry now contains a `winhost` target. Roll back with the relay
  admin `DELETE /api/machines/winhost` endpoint if that target is ever invalid.
- The relay doc is managed by chezmoi. Roll back by reverting the dotfiles commits
  `dfac746`, `e6d5c61`, or `6f8ab6a` as appropriate.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not configure the Windows desktop app to use `winhost-wsl`; the listener is
  expected on the Windows host, not inside WSL.
- Did not broad-watch or auto-sync dotfiles from `$HOME`; the dotfile-sync
  research was kept separate from the relay doc.
- Did not delete any worktrees or branches; the only non-main worktree observed
  was the intentional `marketplace-no-mcp` variant.
- Did not move `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md`; it is still an open plan.

## Open Questions

- No full synthetic OAuth callback was completed from the relay after the user
  confirmed authentication, because that requires Codex to be actively waiting
  for the exact generated callback flow.
- The injected Claude transcript path exists but belongs to an older Claude
  Desktop session in this repo; this note summarizes the current Codex thread
  using the active conversation context and observed command outputs.

## Next Steps

- For any new Codex runtime, add the matching
  `mcp_oauth_callback_url = "https://callback.tootie.tv/callback/<machine>"`
  and `mcp_oauth_callback_port = 38935` to that runtime's Codex config.
- Register the matching relay target with `PUT /api/machines/<machine>` on
  `callback-relay`, using the target machine's Tailscale IP and
  `/callback/<machine>` base path.
- If the relay returns `502`, first confirm Codex is actively waiting for an
  OAuth callback on the target machine and that the stored Tailscale IP is still
  correct.
- Keep dotfile-sync automation in a separate document if it gets written up;
  do not mix it back into the Codex relay reference.
