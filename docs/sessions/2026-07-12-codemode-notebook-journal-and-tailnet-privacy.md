# Code Mode notebook-as-log journal + public-repo Tailscale privacy scrub

## User Request
Started with "use cortex cli search through ai sessions for this repo where we were discussing codemode.step today." That recovered a dormant design thread, which the user then drove end-to-end: `lavra-plan → lavra-eng-review → apply findings → superpowers writing-plans → work-it`. After that merged, the user asked to stop committing real Tailscale IPs / personal devices to the public repo ("cant we have variables for the tailscale ips").

## Session Overview
Two pieces of work, both merged to `main`:
1. **Code Mode notebook-as-log (v1 write half)** — persisted the previously-dormant `codemode.step(name, fn)` journal into a durable, append-only, redacted SQLite store, exposed as a read-only notebook. Shipped via PR #230.
2. **Public-repo privacy scrub (Tier 1)** — removed real Tailscale IPs and the tailnet name from the public `jmagar/labby` repo, moved the OpenWiki CI endpoint to a repo variable. Shipped via PR #231. A broader device-name sweep was attempted, found to collide with the public `tootie.tv` domain and app identifiers, and reverted.

## Sequence of Events
1. Ran `cortex sessions search` (local CLI v3.8.1) for `codemode.step`; cortex's index lagged "today", so cross-checked raw transcripts — found the substantive discussion in a Jul-11 session and the lineage (Jul-1 Cloudflare `proxy-tool.ts` study, Jul-2 PR #182 impl, then the pause gate reverted in `e3575193` leaving `record_step` a no-op).
2. `lavra-plan` → epic `lab-d6ke7` + 5 children.
3. `lavra-eng-review` — 4 parallel agents (architecture, simplicity, security, performance). 16 recommendations applied.
4. `superpowers:writing-plans` → `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-11-codemode-notebook-as-log.md`.
5. `work-it` — FF to main, draft PR #230, implementation agent (4 tasks), 2 review waves (7 fixes), green CI; user merged (squash `7ff89d32`).
6. Privacy request → investigated (repo is PUBLIC), Tier-1 scrub committed (`7da1be5e`), device-name sweep reverted after the `tootie.tv` collision, PR #231 opened and merged by the user.
7. Closeout: closed v1 beads, wrote this log.

## Key Findings
- `codemode.step` hooks (`decide_step`/`record_step`/`decide_local`/`record_local`, `crates/labby-codemode/src/host.rs:132-183`) defaulted to no-op with **no host override** — the journal spine existed end-to-end but nothing persisted it.
- The single `next_runner_seq` spine is valid for intra-run cell attribution but **not** a cross-run replay key (a replayed step skips its internal tool calls, shifting later seqs) — the journal keys on a parent-derived `step_ordinal` instead.
- `record_step` is `await`ed inline on the main `runner_drive.rs` `select!` loop, so a per-step DB write would head-of-line-block the run — resolved with an in-memory buffer + single bulk flush at the run boundary.
- `jmagar/labby` is a **public** repo; real Tailscale IPs `100.99.0.2` (nashost) and `100.99.0.1` (devhost) plus tailnet `example-tailnet.ts.net` were committed. Everything else on `100.64.0.0/10` was already synthetic; SSRF range tests must keep `100.64.0.1`/`100.127.255.255`.
- `tootie.tv` is an intentionally-public domain woven through functional code (Aurora registry URL, Axon OpenAPI URL, Tauri bundle id `tv.tootie.lab.palette`, auth callback tests) — scrubbing it breaks functionality; it is not a private leak.

## Technical Decisions
- **Deferred replay ("run from cell N") to a v2 epic (`lab-5dtw9`)** — the security-critical replay-authorization gap and the seq/determinism crux both live in the replay path; journal-first de-risks it. v1's schema lands forward-compat owner-identity + `replayed_from` columns so v2 drops in cleanly.
- **SQLite over JSONL** — the M2 buffer collapses writes to one bulk insert per execution, erasing the per-write ceremony JSONL was avoiding, while keeping bounded prune + future query + repo convention (`usage/store.rs`).
- **Journaling is fail-open on normal runs** — a flush failure logs and the run still succeeds; the journal is orthogonal to dispatch and never reintroduces the removed pause/confirm gate.
- **Privacy: fix real Tailscale IPs/tailnet only; keep the public `tootie.tv` domain and author attribution** — device codenames without IPs are not network-actionable; scrubbing the domain/app-identifier is breakage, not privacy.

## Repository Maintenance
- **Plans:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-11-codemode-notebook-as-log.md` is complete (merged in #230). It lives under `docs/superpowers/plans/`, not `docs/plans/`, so the `docs/plans/complete/` move convention does not apply; left in place. No `docs/plans/*` needed moving.
- **Beads:** closed v1 epic + 4 children (work + CI verified on `main`); left v2 (`lab-5dtw9`, `lab-d6ke7.4`) and `lab-pyqei` open as tracked follow-ups. Evidence: `bd close` output + squash merge `7ff89d32`.
- **Worktrees/branches:** `claude/cortex-search-codemode-step-d805c7` (PR #230, merged) and `claude/sanitize-tailnet-public` (PR #231, merged) are cleanup candidates but were NOT removed — this session is operating inside the `cortex-search-...` worktree (can't remove the active one) and the branches were just merged. The primary `main` checkout (`/home/jmagar/workspace/lab`) is behind 1 and dirty with unrelated in-progress Code Mode inspector work (`code_mode_app.html`, `handlers_resources.rs`, `call_tool_codemode/tests.rs`) — left untouched (not this session's work).
- **Stale docs:** `docs/dev/CODE_MODE.md` and `docs/dev/ERRORS.md` were updated in #230 (removed the now-false "no durable execution log" claim). No further stale docs found.

## Tools and Skills Used
- **cortex CLI** (`cortex sessions search/projects`, v3.8.1, local SQLite) — recovered the codemode.step history; index lagged same-day sessions so cross-checked raw `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl`.
- **Skills:** `lavra:lavra-plan`, `lavra:lavra-eng-review`, `superpowers:writing-plans`, `vibin:work-it`, `vibin:merge-status`, `vibin:save-to-md`.
- **Subagents:** 4 plan-review agents (lavra review), 1 implementation agent (general-purpose, executed the plan + applied fix batch), 3 post-impl review agents (code-reviewer, silent-failure-hunter, security-sentinel), 1 delta-review agent.
- **Shell/git/gh:** branch/PR management, CI watch (`gh pr checks --watch`), grep/sed for the privacy sweep. **bd** for beads.
- Issues: cortex "today" search returned 0 (indexer lag) — worked around via raw transcripts. The device-name `sed` sweep over-matched the `tootie.tv` domain — caught in review and reverted.

## Commands Executed
| command | result |
|---|---|
| `cortex sessions search 'NEAR(codemode step,0)' --project ...` | located the pivotal sessions |
| `cargo nextest run --all-features` (post-impl) | 1894 passed, 14 skipped |
| `just lint` | clippy -D warnings + fmt clean |
| `gh pr checks 230 --watch` | 32 pass, 1 skipping |
| `git grep -nE '100\.120\.242\.29\|100\.88\.16\.79\|example-tailnet'` (post-scrub) | no matches (real IPs/tailnet gone) |
| `cargo nextest run -p labby -E 'test(incus)'` | 23/23 pass after fixture genericization |

## Errors Encountered
- **Device-name sweep overreach:** a `\btootie\b` sed replace matched `tootie.tv` (public domain) and `tv.tootie.lab.palette` (Tauri bundle id), mangling live Aurora/Axon/labby URLs and app identity. Root cause: word-boundary match didn't exclude the domain form. Resolution: `git checkout -- .` to discard the uncommitted Tier-2 sweep, kept Tier-1 (IPs/tailnet), shipped that as #231, and left device-name scrubbing as an open decision.
- **bash-in-zsh:** an associative-array script failed ("bad substitution") under zsh; re-run under explicit `bash`.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)
| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `codemode.step` | journaled nowhere (no-op hook) | persisted to `~/.labby/codemode_journal.db`, viewable as a notebook (v1 write half) |
| OpenWiki CI endpoint | hardcoded `http://100.99.0.2:8317/v1` fallback | `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` repo variable only; preflight fails clearly if unset |
| Public repo | real Tailscale IPs + tailnet committed | placeholders only; `tootie.tv` public domain preserved |

## Verification Evidence
| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo nextest run --all-features` | all pass | 1894 passed, 14 skipped | pass |
| `just lint` | clean | clippy + fmt clean | pass |
| `gh pr checks 230` | green | 32 pass, 1 skipping | pass |
| `git grep` real IPs/tailnet after #231 | none | none | pass |
| `cargo nextest -p labby test(incus)` | pass | 23/23 | pass |

## Risks and Rollback
- v1 journal persists forward-compat columns but nothing reads them yet (read/replay is v2). Low risk; fail-open means journaling can never break a run.
- Follow-up `lab-pyqei`: the redactor's coverage is narrow (known token shapes only) and now backs a durable store — generic secrets in step values could persist in cleartext. Tracked, non-blocking.
- Rollback: both changes are on merged PRs; revert `7ff89d32` (#230) or `7da1be5e`-range (#231) if needed.

## Decisions Not Taken
- **JSONL store** — rejected; M2 makes SQLite's cost negligible and adds prune/query.
- **Implement replay in v1** — deferred to `lab-5dtw9`; it carries all the security/determinism risk.
- **Blanket device-name scrub / rename `tootie.tv`** — rejected; breaks functional public infra and app identity for negligible privacy gain once IPs are gone.

## Open Questions
- Device-name scrubbing in narrative docs (session logs / fleet references): do a narrow `nashost`-not-`.tv` docs-only sweep, or leave codenames as-is now that IPs are gone? (User leaning: fine as-is.)

## Next Steps
- Optional cleanup: delete merged branches/worktrees `claude/cortex-search-codemode-step-d805c7` and `claude/sanitize-tailnet-public` once outside them.
- Reconcile the dirty Code Mode inspector WIP in the primary `main` checkout, then fast-forward `main`.
- When ready, pick up v2 replay (`lab-5dtw9`) against the now-real journals, and the redaction hardening (`lab-pyqei`).
