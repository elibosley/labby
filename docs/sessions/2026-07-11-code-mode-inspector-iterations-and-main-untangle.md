# Session log: Code Mode inspector iterations, enrichment batch, and the main untangle

Continuation of `docs/sessions/2026-07-10-code-mode-inspector-inline-redesign.md` (same session/worktree). That log covers the redesign, capability audit, first implementation, and discovery rendering. This log covers everything after it: four more feature rounds driven by live usage, a homelab outage diagnosis, and recovering from an accidental merge onto the wrong branch.

## User Request

Iterative asks against the deployed inline inspector: "I need to click the tools being called and see the tool, like the result"; "I need to see the INPUT from the llm for those tool calls"; a screenshot showing redundant status indicators ("cut the redundancy… would it even be possible for that resource to display disconnected?"); "cap the height after ~10 rows"; "implement ALL of your suggestions"; then "the server isn't up or reachable", "repo status", and "fix your fuckin mess. WITHOUT losing any work".

## Session Overview

Shipped four more inspector rounds (expandable tool-detail rows + host-delivered Input row; redundant status indicators removed; 300px body cap with internal scroll; a nine-item enrichment batch spanning Rust emitters and both widget surfaces). Diagnosed a "server unreachable" report as a edgehost (SWAG edge) machine outage, not a labby fault. A repo-status audit then revealed the enrichment batch had been merged into `codex/palette-production-hardening` instead of main — because the primary checkout's branch was switched by a concurrent codex session mid-deploy. Recovered without losing any work: landed the batch on main via a verified merge (full 1813-test suite green first), normalized PR #223 with a content-no-op merge, rebuilt from real main, and redeployed. PR #223 subsequently merged cleanly.

## Sequence of Events

1. **Expandable tool rows + Input row (`f77778c6`).** Discovery match rows became disclosures showing full description, `path · kind · score`, and the TypeScript signature (all present in search-hit entries, previously dropped at parse). Added an Input row surfacing the LLM's tool-call arguments — MCP Apps hosts deliver them via the `ui/notifications/tool-input` bridge notification; OpenAI hosts via `window.openai.toolInput`. No server change needed.
2. **Redundancy cut (`018ce79f`).** From a live screenshot: header ok-dot + CONNECTED badge + lone "live" session pill all said nothing. Bridge-state badge now renders only while the card is empty (connecting/waiting/read only/malformed); session chips render only with 2+ runs. Found and fixed the asset's `.badge{display:inline-flex}` defeating the `hidden` attribute (`[hidden]{display:none!important}`).
3. **Height cap (`80176d7e`).** Body region capped at 300px (~10 rows) with internal Aurora-thin scroll; header/footer pinned. Verified with a 20-call payload: card tops out at 368px (content scrollHeight 585).
4. **Enrichment batch (`bf75ed4a`).** All nine suggestions: (server) failed executes now return a structured trace as `structuredContent` on the error result; trace-level `elapsed_ms` injected by the handler; per-call `start_ms` recorded at dispatch in `runner_drive.rs`; (widget) true waterfall bars, trace-level error kind/elapsed in the header, auto-expand of the first failed call, Artifacts disclosure row, `truncated` chip on Result, copy buttons on code blocks, describe markdown rendered as markdown, and light-theme support in the asset via host context / `openai.theme`.
5. **edgehost outage diagnosis.** "Server isn't up" traced through: gateway healthy on container loopback → Incus proxy device `public-lab` (devhost `0.0.0.0:40100` → container `127.0.0.1:8765`) works → `lab.tootie.tv` and every tootie.tv subdomain return Cloudflare 523 → edgehost off the tailnet (rx 0), no LAN ping, ARP INCOMPLETE, absent from UniFi clients. Machine-level outage on the SWAG edge; labby unaffected; direct URL `http://100.64.0.79:40100` given as workaround.
6. **Repo status audit (vibin:repo-status).** Discovered `bf75ed4a` + merge `9a151abd` were NOT on main: the earlier "merge to main" ran against the primary checkout after a codex session had switched it to `codex/palette-production-hardening` — main's reflog never saw the merge, and PR #223 (draft, CI failing) carried the foreign commits.
7. **The untangle (bead `lab-fl16e`).** Verified PR #223's CI failure came from the palette commit's own test (`crates/labby/src/cli/gateway/dispatch.rs:523`), not the batch. Created a temp main worktree, merged the inspector branch (`0f510ee0`), ran the FULL workspace suite on the merged tree (1813/1813 pass) plus a release build, pushed main. Merged main into the palette branch (verified empty content diff vs first parent) and pushed — GitHub dropped the foreign commits from PR #223's diff. The one remaining code-mode file in #223 (`trace.rs`, +39/−10) was the codex session's own legitimate review fix (drops `absolute_path` from emitted artifact receipts). Redeployed the container from the main-built binary; refreshed `~/.local/bin/labby` (found stale at 1.0.1 — a real file, not the assumed symlink) and `bin/labby`.
8. **Aftermath (verified at save time).** `bf75ed4a` and `0f510ee0` are ancestors of `origin/main`; PR #223 merged at 06:32Z; main advanced further via PR #226; PRs #220 (release-please) and #221 remain open.

## Key Findings

- **The primary checkout is shared mutable state.** `git -C ~/workspace/lab merge` assumes the checkout is on main; a concurrent codex session had switched it to a feature branch, silently redirecting the merge. Root cause of the mess.
- **PR #223 CI failure was palette-owned**: `cli::gateway::dispatch::tests::dispatch_gateway_action_never_builds_local_manager_when_remote_succeeds` panics at `dispatch.rs:523` — a file the inspector batch never touches.
- **Content-no-op merges untangle PRs without rewrites**: after the batch landed on main, merging main into the palette branch (empty diff vs first parent) updated the merge-base so GitHub dropped the foreign commits from #223's commit list and diff. No force pushes; the codex session's in-flight commit (`6f239a10`) and dirty files survived untouched.
- **Turbopack rejects symlinked `node_modules` crossing filesystem roots** ("Symlink … points out of the filesystem root") — the temp-worktree web build had to reuse the primary checkout's export instead (tree hashes for `apps/gateway-admin` verified identical: `43ab5885…`).
- **`~/.local/bin/labby` was a stale 1.0.1 copy**, not a symlink into `target/release` — PATH binary drift can silently survive `just build-release` cycles.
- **The Incus proxy device is the reachability contract**: labby binds container-loopback `127.0.0.1:8765` by config; external access is devhost `:40100` via the `public-lab` proxy device; public HTTPS is Cloudflare → SWAG (edgehost) → devhost. A 523 means the edgehost hop, not the gateway.
- **In-sandbox search-hit entries carry `signature`/`path`/`kind`/`score`** (preamble closure) and MCP Apps hosts deliver tool-call arguments to widgets — both enabled "show the tool" and "show the input" without server changes.

## Technical Decisions

- **Input row from the host bridge, not the trace** — the snippet is stored server-side but CLI-only; `ontoolinput` / `openai.toolInput` deliver it client-side with zero payload growth. Hidden gracefully if a host never sends it.
- **Status badge only on empty cards** — a rendered widget cannot truthfully claim anything but connected; the label's only job is explaining an empty card. Session chips need 2+ runs to be a switcher.
- **`start_ms` as `Option<u128>` on `CodeModeExecutedCall`** — synthetic entries (budget rejections, artifact pseudo-calls) have no meaningful dispatch time; the widget falls back to duration bars when offsets are absent (old payloads/history).
- **Recovery via merges only** — no rebase/force-push on a branch actively worked by another agent session; the accidental-merge commit remains in history (harmless once deduplicated by the main landing).
- **Full workspace suite before pushing main** (not just code-mode-scoped tests) — the push bypassed PR CI, so local verification had to match CI's `Test` job.

## Repository Maintenance

- **Plans**: `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` remains the only active plan — unrelated to this session, left in place. No completed plans to move.
- **Beads**: five beads created/claimed/closed this session (table above); `lab-hth45` remains as the tracked follow-up. `bd dolt pull` ran before the first code commit of the session.
- **Worktrees/branches**: this branch is fully merged into `origin/main` except this log commit; the worktree is this session's active checkout — removal left to the user (`git worktree remove … && git branch -d …` after the log rides a merge). `claude/codex-cli-0144-release-0c3513` (+worktree, clean, at old main) looks stale but its ownership is unclear (possibly another Claude session) — left alone. Codex worktrees (several, some locked) and `marketplace-no-mcp` (protected long-lived variant, behind 473) — untouched by policy. The temp `main-landing` worktree used for the recovery was removed after use (verified gone).
- **Stale docs**: `docs/services/GATEWAY.md` / `docs/surfaces/MCP.md` were re-checked in the prior log and not contradicted by this round's changes; no edits needed. The proxies doc showing `lab.tootie.tv → 100.64.0.79:8765` disagrees with the live SWAG conf (routes to the Incus container via `:40100` per the 2026-07-02 session) — regenerating `~/docs` sidecars is homelab-side (chezmoi), out of repo scope; flagged here instead.
- **Transparency**: main was pushed directly (no PR) after a full local workspace test run — see Risks. The palette branch was pushed while a codex session actively worked it; the merge was verified content-empty and their dirty files re-checked after.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Skills**: `vibin:repo-status` (evidence collector + summarizer + mergeability probe; `summarize_context.py` needed an explicit `python3` invocation — not executable), `vibin:save-to-md` (this log and its predecessor).
- **Shell/git**: extensive — worktrees, reflog forensics, ancestry checks, tree-hash comparison, temp-worktree merges, `gh` for PR/CI/job-log evidence.
- **Rust toolchain**: `cargo nextest` (scoped and full-workspace), `cargo build --release` with shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `cargo fmt`; lefthook pre-commit (clippy/fmt) on every commit.
- **Frontend**: `tsx --test` (node test runner + happy-dom), `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `pnpm build` (Next/Turbopack).
- **agent-browser CLI** (via `npx`; mise shim broken all session): screenshot/interaction verification of every widget round, including a preview-harness quoting bug (shell heredoc collapsing `\\n`) that briefly masqueraded as a widget failure.
- **incus**: file push / exec / systemctl for three container deploys; config inspection (proxy device) during the outage diagnosis.
- **runifi CLI + tailscale**: UniFi client-table and tailnet evidence for the edgehost outage.
- **beads (`bd`)**: create/claim/close per round.
- Degraded/unavailable: edgehost-hosted services (SWAG edge down); the session's labby MCP connection dropped when edgehost died.

## Commands Executed

- `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features` (merged main, temp worktree, shared target) — 1813/1813 pass; the gate before pushing main.
- `git push origin main` — `d3130df4..0f510ee0`.
- `git merge main --no-edit` on `codex/palette-production-hardening` + `git diff HEAD^1 HEAD --stat` (empty) + push — PR #223 normalization.
- `incus exec labby -- systemctl stop labby.service && incus file push … && … systemctl start` — three deploys this session; final one from real main.
- `gh run view --job 86511823866 --log-failed` — attributed PR #223's Test failure to `dispatch.rs:523`.
- `git reflog show main` — proved the accidental merge never touched `refs/heads/main`.

## Errors Encountered

- **Accidental merge onto the wrong branch** — `git -C ~/workspace/lab merge` executed after a codex session switched that checkout's branch; caught by the repo-status audit, recovered via `lab-fl16e` (no work lost, no rewrites).
- **First rebuild raced the same divergence** — the `--ff-only` failure was swallowed by a pipe (`| tail -1`) and the build proceeded against pre-merge sources; caught and rebuilt after the real merge. Lesson: don't chain `… | tail && build`.
- **Turbopack symlinked-node_modules rejection** in the temp worktree — worked around by building the export in the primary checkout (tree-hash-verified identical) and copying `out/`.
- **mise trust** required for the temp worktree; **`[hidden]` vs explicit `display`** CSS gotcha in the asset; **stale `~/.local/bin/labby`** (1.0.1 real file) refreshed; **preview-harness heredoc quoting** produced a JS SyntaxError unrelated to the widget.
- **edgehost hard down** (external): no L2/L3/tailnet/UniFi presence — needs a physical power cycle; not resolved from this session.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| tool rows (discovery) | static one-liners | click-to-expand: full description, path · kind · score, TS signature |
| LLM input | invisible | Input row with the exact snippet (host-delivered), expandable |
| status indicators | ok-dot + CONNECTED badge + lone "live" pill | one ok-dot; badge only on empty cards; chips only with 2+ runs |
| card height | unbounded (grew per row) | 300px body cap, internal scroll, pinned header/footer |
| failed runs | no inline render (error text only) | full trace card: error kind in header, failing call auto-expanded |
| call timing | duration-only bars, elapsed via fragile history join | true waterfall from `start_ms`; trace-level `elapsed_ms` |
| result extras | none | artifacts row, truncated chip, copy buttons, describe markdown, light theme |
| main branch | missing the batch (mis-merged into PR #223) | batch landed (`0f510ee0`), PR #223 clean, since merged |
| deployed container | built from an unreviewed feature branch state | built from real main; reproducible |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tsx --test` code-mode suites (per round) | all pass | 28 → 29 → 34/34 pass | pass |
| `cargo nextest -E 'test(code_mode)'` + labby-codemode crate | all pass | 54/54 + 179/179 | pass |
| full workspace nextest on merged main | all pass | 1813/1813 (14 skipped) | pass |
| browser drives (every round: input/expand, badge/chips, 20-call cap, failed-run waterfall, light-theme describe) | matches design, console clean | matched; screenshots captured | pass |
| `git diff HEAD^1 HEAD --stat` after palette normalization | empty | empty | pass |
| container `/health` + code markers after each deploy | ok + markers present | ok, fresh pids; markers found | pass |
| `git merge-base --is-ancestor bf75ed4a origin/main` (at save time) | ancestor | ancestor; PR #223 MERGED 06:32Z | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- **Main was pushed directly** (no PR/CI) after a full local workspace run; CI subsequently ran on main via later PR merges without reported breakage. Rollback of the batch: revert `0f510ee0` on main, rebuild, redeploy.
- **Pushing to another agent's active branch** (`33f70658` onto the palette branch) was content-empty and non-destructive, but set the precedent carefully — verified their dirty files and new commit survived; PR #223 merged fine afterwards.
- Failed-execute structured traces have no Rust integration test (needs a broker-failure harness) — recorded on `lab-xvb6h` at close.

## Decisions Not Taken

- **Rebasing the foreign commits out of the palette branch** — rejected: history rewrite + force push on a branch actively worked by another session, against the "lose no work" constraint.
- **Cherry-picking the codex `trace.rs` privacy fix (drops `absolute_path`) onto main** — left to land via PR #223 (it did) rather than duplicating the hunk.
- **`tailscale serve` inside the labby container** as an HTTPS fallback during the edgehost outage — offered, not executed.

## Open Questions

- Does Claude's mobile MCP host emit `ui/notifications/tool-input`? If not, the Input row stays hidden there (graceful, but worth confirming on-device).
- Who owns the `claude/codex-cli-0144-release-0c3513` worktree/branch (clean, at old main)? Safe-looking cleanup candidate, left pending ownership.
- `~/docs/homelab/proxies.md` still shows `lab.tootie.tv → 100.64.0.79:8765` (pre-Incus route) — regenerate the homelab sidecars when convenient.

## Next Steps

1. Power-cycle **edgehost** — the SWAG edge is still hard down; until then use `http://100.64.0.79:40100` for the gateway.
2. Exercise the enriched inspector from a real host (failed run, waterfall, artifacts, Input row) — everything verified in-browser but not yet on-device post-batch.
3. After this log lands on main (rides this branch's next merge), remove this worktree/branch: `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/code-inspector-redesign-57a0f0 && git branch -d claude/code-inspector-redesign-57a0f0`.
4. Open follow-ups: `lab-hth45` (pre-existing test failure), `lab-bbzs3` (legacy search/execute compat tool removal), PR #220 (release timing — the next release now includes all inspector work), PR #221 (rebase against the redesigned inspector).
