# Labby Codex bearer token session

## User Request

The session started with a request to "test quick-shell mcp ui via labby", then narrowed sharply to calling the Labby Code Mode tool visibly in the current Codex session. After the visible app connector failed with OAuth reauthentication, the explicit request was: "CONFIGURE CODEX TO USE BEARER TOKEN", targeting `winhost-WSL:/MNT/C/USERS/JMAGA/.CODEX`.

## Session Overview

The session validated the Labby quick-shell path, identified a difference between a shell-launched MCP client and a visible in-session MCP app connector call, configured winhost Codex to use the Labby bearer-token MCP endpoint, and retried the visible in-session Labby tool. The raw bearer-token MCP path was verified from `winhost-wsl`, while the current in-session `codex_apps` Labby connector still failed with `oauth_refresh_token_missing`.

## Sequence of Events

1. Labby and web-testing skills were used for the original quick-shell MCP UI check.
2. A shell MCP client successfully called Labby MCP `codemode`, which then called `quick-shell::open_quick_shell`.
3. The user pointed out that the call was not visible as an in-session MCP tool call, because it appeared only as a shell command.
4. The visible `mcp__codex_apps__labby._codemode` tool was discovered and called; it failed before Code Mode execution with `UNAUTHORIZED` and `oauth_refresh_token_missing`.
5. Codex config was inspected first on the local devhost path, then the user corrected the target to `winhost-wsl:/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex`.
6. winhost Codex was configured to use `https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp` with `bearer_token_env_var = "LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN"`, and the Windows user environment received both `LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` and `LAB_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`.
7. winhost-Wsl bearer auth was verified against the MCP endpoint with HTTP 200, 12 listed tools, `codemode=true`, and `quick_shell_visible=true`.
8. After a context restart, the visible `mcp__codex_apps__labby._codemode` call was tried again in this session and still failed via the app connector OAuth path.
9. The user invoked `vibin:save-to-md`, so this artifact was written and committed as the session log.

## Key Findings

- The visible in-session Labby app connector is `mcp__codex_apps__labby._codemode`, and it failed with `error_code=UNAUTHORIZED`, `action=TRIGGER_REAUTHENTICATION`, and `reason=oauth_refresh_token_missing`.
- Codex CLI supports HTTP MCP bearer configuration through `bearer_token_env_var`, observed via `codex mcp add --help` and `CODEX_HOME=/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex codex mcp get labby`.
- The winhost Codex config before the change used `url = "https://labby.tootie.tv/mcp"` with no bearer token env var.
- The configured winhost raw MCP server uses `url = "https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp"` and `bearer_token_env_var = "LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN"`.
- A bearer-auth MCP probe from winhost-Wsl returned HTTP 200, and `tools/list` returned 12 tools with `codemode=true` and `quick_shell_visible=true`.
- An earlier maintenance read showed a transient diff in `crates/labby/src/api/services/server_logs.rs`; a repeat immediately before committing the session artifact showed no repo diff beyond the untracked session file.

## Technical Decisions

- Use Codex's native `bearer_token_env_var` instead of embedding the token in `config.toml`, keeping the secret out of the checked-in or displayed config.
- Use the bearer-tested public MCP endpoint `https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp` rather than the OAuth-facing `https://labby.tootie.tv/mcp` entry that was present in winhost Codex config.
- Set both `LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` and the legacy `LAB_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` as Windows user environment variables so Codex Desktop has the modern and compatibility names available after restart.
- Leave the visible `codex_apps` connector OAuth problem separate from the raw `mcp_servers.labby` bearer-token configuration, because the current session still routed the visible app tool through the OAuth connector.
- Leave existing worktrees untouched during the save-to-md maintenance pass because merge safety and ownership were not proven.

## Files Changed

| status | path | previous path | purpose | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| modified | `/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex/config.toml` | - | Configure the winhost Codex raw `labby` MCP server to use `https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp` and `bearer_token_env_var = "LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN"`. | `CODEX_HOME=/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex codex mcp get labby` reported the new URL and env var. |
| created | `/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex/config.toml.bak.20260713T011912Z-labby-bearer` | - | Backup of the winhost Codex config before the bearer-token edit. | Remote edit command printed `backup config.toml.bak.20260713T011912Z-labby-bearer`. |
| created | `docs/sessions/2026-07-13-labby-codex-bearer-token.md` | - | Session artifact required by `vibin:save-to-md`. | Created in this save-to-md pass and committed alone. |

## Beads Activity

| bead | title | action(s) | final status | why it mattered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| lab-fvwgy | Investigate current main CI failure | Read with `bd show lab-fvwgy --json`; no state change in this save-to-md pass. Recent comments record the active CI branch context and the Windows TOML path issue. | in_progress | Active branch context is tied to this bead. |
| lab-cqqg6 | Investigate current OpenWiki Update failure | Read with `bd show lab-cqqg6 --json`; no state change in this save-to-md pass. | closed | Recent branch context includes commits that fixed OpenWiki CI before this session log. |
| lab-6vlz0 | Refresh proxied resources after lazy upstream connect | Read with `bd show lab-6vlz0 --json`; no state change in this save-to-md pass. | closed | Directly related to quick-shell resource visibility behind Labby. |
| lab-semog | Surface upstream MCP UI inside Code Mode | Read with `bd show lab-semog --json`; no state change in this save-to-md pass. | closed | Directly related to Code Mode trace and upstream MCP UI propagation. |

No bead was created or closed during this save-to-md pass. The remaining in-session issue, verifying the raw bearer MCP server after restarting Codex Desktop, is an operator follow-up rather than an observed repo code task.

## Repository Maintenance

### Plans

- Checked `docs/plans` with `find docs/plans -maxdepth 2 -type f`.
- `docs/plans/complete/mcp-streamable-http-oauth-proxy.md` was already under `complete/`.
- `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` was left in place because its header says `Status: open` and it describes future phased work.
- No plan files were moved.

### Beads

- Checked relevant beads with `bd show lab-fvwgy`, `bd show lab-cqqg6`, `bd show lab-6vlz0`, and `bd show lab-semog`.
- No bead status changes were made during this pass.
- `bd list --all --sort updated --reverse --limit 100 --json` and `.beads/interactions.jsonl` were also inspected, but their broad outputs were too large and were used only to confirm recent tracker activity.

### Worktrees and branches

- `git worktree list --porcelain` showed two worktrees: `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab` on `codex/bd-lab-fvwgy-ci-failure` and `/home/jmagar/workspace/_no_mcp_worktrees/lab` on `marketplace-no-mcp`.
- `codex/bd-lab-fvwgy-ci-failure` is the active PR branch for PR #237 and is not merged to `origin/main`; no cleanup was safe.
- `marketplace-no-mcp` is checked out in a separate worktree and is not merged to `origin/main`; no cleanup was safe.
- `git status -sb` showed the current branch matched its upstream before this session artifact commit.

### Stale docs

- No Lab docs contradicted the session outcome. This was an operator/config session involving winhost Codex config, not a Lab source or docs behavior change.
- No docs were updated beyond this session artifact.

### Skipped or blocked cleanup

- A repeated `git status --short` before the session commit showed only the untracked session artifact; no source-file cleanup was performed.
- No worktrees or branches were deleted because neither branch was proven merged or obsolete.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Skills.** `labby:using-labby` was used for Labby/Code Mode calls and config interpretation. `vibin:save-to-md` was used to create this session artifact and required the maintenance, commit, and push workflow.
- **MCP tools.** `tool_search` exposed the in-session Labby tool. `mcp__codex_apps__labby._codemode` was called visibly and failed with OAuth reauthentication required.
- **Shell commands.** Used `ssh`, `codex mcp`, `curl`, `git`, `gh`, `bd`, `jq`, `rg`, `sed`, `awk`, and PowerShell through WSL interop for config, auth, repo, and tracker evidence.
- **External CLIs.** `codex` confirmed the MCP server config shape; `bd` provided bead state; `gh` provided PR state.
- **File tools.** `apply_patch` created this markdown artifact. Shell reads inspected config snippets, transcript content, diffs, and plans.
- **Issues encountered.** Broad `rg` and `bd list` outputs were truncated; remote shell quoting caused one Python edit command and one PowerShell env-var command to fail before making changes; the MCP `tools/list` response was SSE-framed and needed a corrected parser.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `codex mcp add --help` | Confirmed `--bearer-token-env-var <ENV_VAR>` is supported for streamable HTTP MCP servers. |
| `ssh winhost-wsl 'CODEX_HOME=/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex codex mcp get labby'` | Reported `transport: streamable_http`, `url: https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp`, and `bearer_token_env_var: LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`. |
| `ssh winhost-wsl 'sed -n "126,134p" /mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex/config.toml'` | Showed the edited `[mcp_servers.labby]` section. |
| `curl -X POST https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp ... initialize` | Bearer-auth MCP initialize probe returned HTTP 200 from winhost-Wsl. |
| `curl -X POST https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp ... tools/list` | Returned 12 tools after SSE parsing; `codemode=true` and `quick_shell_visible=true`. |
| `mcp__codex_apps__labby._codemode` | Visible in-session tool call failed with `UNAUTHORIZED` and `oauth_refresh_token_missing`. |
| `git status --short` | Final pre-commit check showed only the untracked session artifact. |
| `gh pr view --json number,title,url,headRefName,baseRefName,state` | Reported open PR #237 from `codex/bd-lab-fvwgy-ci-failure` to `main`. |
| `find docs/plans -maxdepth 2 -type f` | Found one completed plan already in `docs/plans/complete` and one open fleet WS plan left in place. |
| `bd show lab-fvwgy --json` | Reported `lab-fvwgy` as `in_progress` with CI investigation comments. |

## Errors Encountered

- A successful Labby Code Mode call was first made through a shell MCP client, which did not satisfy the user's request for a visible in-session MCP tool call.
- The visible `mcp__codex_apps__labby._codemode` call failed with `oauth_refresh_token_missing`, proving the current session still used the OAuth app connector path.
- The initial local Codex config target was wrong for the user's machine; the target was corrected to `winhost-wsl:/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex`.
- One remote Python edit command failed on shell quoting before writing anything; it was rerun with safer quoting.
- One PowerShell env-var command failed because `$t` was expanded by the remote shell before PowerShell ran; it was rerun with escaped PowerShell variables and stored 64-character values.
- `codex --strict-config mcp get labby` failed because `--strict-config` is not supported for `codex mcp`; `codex mcp get labby` was used instead.
- A quick parser initially failed on the MCP `tools/list` response because the response was SSE-framed; parsing was corrected to use the final `data:` frame.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| winhost Codex raw `labby` MCP server | Pointed at `https://labby.tootie.tv/mcp` with no bearer-token env var. | Points at `https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp` with `bearer_token_env_var = "LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN"`. |
| Windows user environment on winhost | `LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` was not observed as present. | `LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` and `LAB_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` were stored as Windows user env vars with length 64. |
| Raw bearer MCP connectivity from winhost-Wsl | Not configured/verified in Codex config. | MCP initialize returned HTTP 200 and tool discovery exposed `codemode` and quick-shell. |
| Current in-session visible Labby app connector | Required OAuth reauthentication. | Still requires OAuth reauthentication until a restart/new session loads the raw bearer MCP server surface or the app connector is reauthenticted. |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CODEX_HOME=/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex codex mcp get labby` | Labby raw MCP config uses bearer env var. | Reported `url: https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp` and `bearer_token_env_var: LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`. | pass |
| PowerShell user env check on winhost | Both Labby token env vars exist without printing the token. | `LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN user length: 64`; `LAB_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN user length: 64`. | pass |
| Bearer `initialize` request to `https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp` from winhost-Wsl | Authenticated MCP endpoint returns success. | `http_code=200`. | pass |
| Bearer `tools/list` request to `https://mcp.tootie.tv/mcp` from winhost-Wsl | Labby exposes Code Mode and quick-shell. | `tools=12`, `codemode=true`, `quick_shell_visible=true`. | pass |
| Visible `mcp__codex_apps__labby._codemode` call in this session | Call should reach Code Mode. | Failed before execution with `UNAUTHORIZED` and `oauth_refresh_token_missing`. | warn |

## Risks and Rollback

- The raw bearer MCP config is written outside the repo in `/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex/config.toml`. Roll back by restoring `/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex/config.toml.bak.20260713T011912Z-labby-bearer`.
- Windows Codex Desktop may need a restart or fresh session to inherit the new user environment variables and reload raw MCP server configuration.
- The current visible `codex_apps` Labby connector remains OAuth-backed and may continue to fail independently of the raw `mcp_servers.labby` bearer config.
- The token was not embedded in the Codex config, but it is now stored in the Windows user environment on winhost.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not embed the Labby bearer token directly in `config.toml`; this avoided placing a secret in a config file that could later be captured by dotfile tooling.
- Did not force the current `codex_apps` connector to use bearer auth; this session only exposed a separate OAuth app connector tool, while the raw MCP server config is loaded by Codex session startup.
- Did not alter repo source files during the save-to-md pass; the final pre-commit status showed only the session artifact.
- Did not delete `marketplace-no-mcp`; repo instructions identify it as an intentional long-lived branch, and it is checked out in a separate worktree.

## Open Questions

- After restarting Codex Desktop or starting a fresh task, will the raw `mcp_servers.labby` bearer-token server appear as a visible callable Labby tool separate from `mcp__codex_apps__labby._codemode`?
- Should the OAuth app connector be reauthenticated or disabled if the raw bearer MCP server is now the preferred Labby path?

## Next Steps

- Restart Codex Desktop on winhost or start a fresh Codex session so the process inherits `LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` and reloads `/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/.codex/config.toml`.
- In the fresh session, call the raw Labby MCP server's `codemode` tool and then call `quick-shell::open_quick_shell` through Code Mode.
- Decide whether to reauthenticate or remove the OAuth-backed `codex_apps` Labby connector to avoid confusion with the bearer-backed raw MCP server.
- Finish PR #237 separately and close `lab-fvwgy` only after CI verification is observed.
