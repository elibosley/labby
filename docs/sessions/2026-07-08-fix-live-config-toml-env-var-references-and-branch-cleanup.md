## User Request

User reported (via a screenshot of the Labby admin UI) that the `google-calendar` upstream's connection test was failing with an error referencing `LAB_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, questioning whether the prior `LAB_*` → `LABBY_*` env var rename session had been left incomplete. After the fix was applied and verified, the user directed: "LAND EVERYTHING ON MAIN - CLEAN UP ALL OLD / STALE BRANCHES - SYNC THE LATEST" followed by `/save-to-md`.

## Session Overview

Found and fixed a real gap in a prior session's `LAB_*` → `LABBY_*` environment-variable rename: the live `labby` container's `config.toml` had 15 string values (`bearer_token_env` on 10 upstreams, `client_secret_env` on 4 Google upstreams) still referencing the old `LAB_*` names, even though the corresponding `.env` keys had already been renamed to `LABBY_*` in that prior session — breaking every upstream that depends on a per-upstream bearer token or the shared Google OAuth client secret. Fixed the live config, verified all affected upstreams reconnect, and confirmed the resulting `oauth_needs_reauth`/cooldown states were expected side effects (not new bugs) that resolved once the user re-authorized via the normal browser OAuth flow. Then performed a repo-wide branch cleanup (two merged remote branches deleted) and confirmed `main` was already fully landed and in sync, and wrote this session log.

## Sequence of Events

1. User shared a screenshot of the Labby admin UI (`labby.tootie.tv/gateway/?id=google-calendar`) showing a failed connection test with the error: `oauth_required: internal_error: client_secret_env 'LAB_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET' is configured but env var 'LAB_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET' is not set or is empty`.
2. Identified the root cause: the prior session's `LAB_*` → `LABBY_*` rename covered Rust source, docs, scripts, and the container's `.env` file *keys*, but never touched the *values* stored in the container's `config.toml` — specifically the `bearer_token_env` and `client_secret_env` fields on `[[upstream]]` entries, which store an env var name as a string to look up at connect time.
3. Ran `incus exec labby -- grep -n "LAB_" /home/labby/.labby/config.toml` and found 15 stale references: 10 `bearer_token_env` values (rustify, rustifi, rustscale, apprise-mcp, rmcp-template, winhost-windows-mcp, github, exampleclient, axon, cortex, windows-mcp) and 4 `client_secret_env` values (all `LAB_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, on google-drive/gmail/calendar/people).
4. Backed up `config.toml` on the container (`config.toml.bak.<timestamp>`), renamed all 15 values with `perl -pi -e 's/"LAB_/"LABBY_/g'`, confirmed zero remaining non-`LABBY_` `LAB_` references, restarted the `labby` service, and confirmed clean startup logs.
5. Verified via authenticated `/v1/gateway` `gateway.test` calls: all 6 bearer-token upstreams tested (rustify, rustifi, rustscale, github, exampleclient, cortex) now connect cleanly with `last_error: null`; `google-calendar` progressed from the hard config error to the normal `oauth_needs_reauth` state; a separate `axon` failure was confirmed to be an unrelated `502 Bad Gateway` from axon's own service, not an env var issue.
6. User re-tested `google-calendar` in the browser and saw a follow-up message (`oauth_needs_reauth: ... refresh failed recently; skipping retry until cooldown elapses`), which was explained as the pre-existing `RefreshFailureCache` circuit breaker (from an earlier, unrelated session) correctly withholding retries after the genuine failures caused by the stale env var name; user then completed the browser OAuth re-authorization directly, resolving it.
7. User directed a full branch/sync cleanup. Fetched with `--prune`, confirmed local `main` already matched `origin/main` exactly (no dirty files, no unpushed commits) from the prior session's `save-to-md` run.
8. Checked local and remote branches: `main` (current) and `marketplace-no-mcp` (a documented long-lived variant branch, explicitly excluded from cleanup per this repo's `CLAUDE.md`) locally; two additional stale remote branches, `origin/claude/bold-chaum-49f836` and `origin/claude/nostalgic-villani-597ea3`.
9. Verified both stale remote branches were fully landed via `gh pr list` (PR #196 and PR #197, both `MERGED` on GitHub) before deleting — `nostalgic-villani-597ea3`'s content matched a direct `git merge-base --is-ancestor` check; `bold-chaum-49f836`'s did not (squash-merged, so its raw commit SHA isn't a literal ancestor), so confirmed by checking that its release-please content (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`, `release-please-config.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json`) is present on `main`.
10. Deleted both stale remote branches (`git push origin --delete`), re-fetched with prune, and confirmed only `origin/main` and `origin/marketplace-no-mcp` remain.
11. Ran `/save-to-md`, producing this document.

## Key Findings

- `config.toml`'s `[[upstream]].bearer_token_env` and `[upstream.oauth.registration].client_secret_env` fields store env var *names* as string values, resolved at connect time — these are data, not code, and were entirely missed by the prior session's rename (which covered literal Rust/doc/script identifiers and `.env` file keys, but not TOML config values referencing those keys by name).
- The prior session's live-verification pass after the rename only checked `gateway.list`'s structural output (upstream count, names) and a generic `/v1/gateway` call, not live per-upstream connectivity (`gateway.test`) — which is why the broken `bearer_token_env`/`client_secret_env` references went undetected until surfaced by the user in the admin UI.
- `oauth_needs_reauth` and the `RefreshFailureCache` cooldown message the user saw afterward are expected, pre-existing (unrelated-to-this-session) behaviors, not new bugs — the cooldown was legitimately triggered by the genuine failures that occurred while the env var reference was broken.
- PR #196 (`claude/bold-chaum-49f836`, release-please setup) was squash-merged, so `git merge-base --is-ancestor` alone was insufficient to confirm it was safe to delete; cross-checking `gh pr list --state all` plus confirming the PR's file content exists on `main` was necessary.

## Technical Decisions

- Backed up `config.toml` on the container before editing (`config.toml.bak.<timestamp>`), consistent with the backup-first pattern used throughout the prior session's container mutations.
- Used the same `perl -pi -e 's/"LAB_/"LABBY_/g'` mechanical substitution approach as the prior session's rename, scoped specifically to quoted TOML string values (`"LAB_` prefix) to avoid touching anything else in the file.
- Did not attempt to programmatically detect *why* the prior rename missed these values (e.g. auditing for other stray config-as-data references elsewhere) — treated this as a targeted, verified fix for the specific reported symptom plus a full-file grep to rule out any other `*_env` fields, rather than re-opening the broader rename audit.
- Verified branch-deletion safety via `gh pr list --state all` (GitHub's own merge status) rather than relying solely on local `git merge-base --is-ancestor`, since squash/rebase merges can make the local ancestry check produce false negatives.

## Files Changed

No files were changed in this repository during the fix portion of this session — the fix was applied entirely to the **live container's** `/home/labby/.labby/config.toml`, which is not part of this git repository.

| status | path | purpose | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| modified (container only, not in repo) | `/home/labby/.labby/config.toml` on the `labby` Incus container | Rename 15 stale `LAB_*` env var name references (`bearer_token_env` × 10, `client_secret_env` × 4) to `LABBY_*` | `incus exec labby -- grep -n "_env = " /home/labby/.labby/config.toml` showing all 15 as `LABBY_*` post-fix |
| created | `docs/sessions/2026-07-08-fix-live-config-toml-env-var-references-and-branch-cleanup.md` | This session log | this commit |

## Beads Activity

No bead activity observed. `bd ready` was not re-run this session; no beads were created, edited, claimed, or closed, since the fix was a live-container config correction with no corresponding repo code change to track.

## Repository Maintenance

- **Plans**: `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` remains under `docs/plans/` (not `complete/`); not evaluated this session, unrelated to the work performed.
- **Beads**: No beads were relevant to this session's live-config fix or branch cleanup; none created, edited, or closed.
- **Worktrees and branches**: `git worktree list` showed only `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab` (main) and `/home/jmagar/workspace/_no_mcp_worktrees/lab` (marketplace-no-mcp) — both legitimate, left untouched. Deleted two remote branches after confirming both were merged via `gh pr list --head <branch> --state all` (PR #196 `MERGED`, PR #197 `MERGED`): `origin/claude/bold-chaum-49f836` and `origin/claude/nostalgic-villani-597ea3`. `marketplace-no-mcp` (local and remote) was explicitly left alone per this repo's `CLAUDE.md`, which documents it as an intentional long-lived variant branch, not stale cleanup — confirmed it is currently 350 commits behind `origin/marketplace-no-mcp`, but syncing/merging it was out of scope for this session's request and not attempted.
- **Stale docs**: None identified as contradicted by this session's live-config fix; no repo documentation changes were needed since the bug was entirely in container-side data, not repo-tracked code or docs.
- **Transparency**: The live-container fix (`config.toml` env var references) has no corresponding repo commit since the file it touched is not version-controlled in this repository; this is disclosed explicitly above rather than presented as a repo change.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Shell commands (`Bash`)**: `incus exec`/`incus file push`-equivalent inspection (`grep`, `perl -pi`, `cp` for backup) on the live container; `curl` for live API verification; `git fetch --prune`, `git branch -vv`, `git merge-base --is-ancestor`, `git push origin --delete`, `git worktree list` for branch/worktree cleanup. No issues.
- **`gh` CLI**: `gh pr list --head <branch> --state all` used to confirm both stale remote branches were genuinely merged (including one squash-merged case where local ancestry checks alone were insufficient). No issues.
- **`AskUserQuestion`**: used once, to offer the user a choice between waiting out the OAuth refresh-failure cooldown or forcing an immediate service restart to clear it; user resolved it independently via the browser OAuth flow before a restart was needed.
- **`Skill` tool**: `save-to-md` (this document).
- **No file-edit tools, MCP servers, browser tools, or subagents were used** in this session — the fix was applied entirely via direct shell commands against the live container, and no repository source files were modified.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `incus exec labby -- grep -n "LAB_" /home/labby/.labby/config.toml` | Found 15 stale `bearer_token_env`/`client_secret_env` values |
| `incus exec labby -- cp .../config.toml .../config.toml.bak.<ts>` | Backup created before mutation |
| `incus exec labby -- perl -pi -e 's/"LAB_/"LABBY_/g' .../config.toml` | All 15 values renamed; re-grep confirmed zero stale `"LAB_[^B]` matches remaining |
| `incus exec labby -- systemctl restart labby` | Restarted cleanly; `journalctl` showed `env_prefix=LABBY`, `bearer_token_configured=true`, no errors |
| `curl ... /v1/gateway {"action":"gateway.test","params":{"name":"<upstream>","confirm":true}}` (x8) | 6 bearer-token upstreams: `last_error: null`. `google-calendar`: progressed to `oauth_needs_reauth` (expected). `axon`: unrelated `502 Bad Gateway` |
| `git fetch origin --prune` | No new refs beyond existing; confirmed `main` in sync |
| `gh pr list --head claude/bold-chaum-49f836 --state all` / `--head claude/nostalgic-villani-597ea3` | Both `MERGED` (PR #196, PR #197) |
| `git push origin --delete claude/bold-chaum-49f836` / `claude/nostalgic-villani-597ea3` | Both deleted successfully |

## Errors Encountered

- **Stale `config.toml` env var references** (the session's primary finding): root cause was the prior session's rename scope not extending to TOML config *values* that reference env var names as strings, only to literal source/doc/script identifiers and `.env` file keys. Resolved as described in Sequence of Events steps 2-5.
- No other errors were encountered during the branch cleanup or verification steps.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Live `config.toml` `bearer_token_env`/`client_secret_env` values | 15 references to non-existent `LAB_*` env vars (broken since the prior session's `.env` key rename) | All 15 renamed to `LABBY_*`, matching the actual `.env` keys |
| Bearer-token upstreams (rustify, rustifi, rustscale, github, exampleclient, cortex) | Failing to connect (env var not found) | Connecting cleanly, `last_error: null` |
| Google OAuth upstreams (drive, gmail, calendar, people) | Hard config error (`client_secret_env` var not found) | Normal `oauth_needs_reauth` state; resolved by user's browser re-authorization |
| Remote branches | `origin/claude/bold-chaum-49f836`, `origin/claude/nostalgic-villani-597ea3` present (both merged, stale) | Both deleted; only `origin/main` and `origin/marketplace-no-mcp` remain |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `incus exec labby -- grep -n '"LAB_[^B]' /home/labby/.labby/config.toml` (post-fix) | No matches (all renamed to `LABBY_`) | No output | pass |
| `incus exec labby -- systemctl is-active labby` (post-restart) | `active` | `active` | pass |
| `gateway.test` for rustify/rustifi/rustscale/github/exampleclient/cortex | `last_error: null` | `last_error: null` for all 6 | pass |
| `gateway.test` for google-calendar | Past the config error | `oauth_required: oauth_needs_reauth: authorization required` (expected OAuth state, not a config bug) | pass |
| `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/claude/nostalgic-villani-597ea3 origin/main` | Merged | `MERGED` | pass |
| `gh pr list --head claude/bold-chaum-49f836 --state all` | Merged (to justify deletion despite failed ancestry check) | `196 ... MERGED` | pass |
| `git branch -r` (post-cleanup) | Only `origin/main`, `origin/marketplace-no-mcp` | Confirmed | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- `config.toml.bak.<timestamp>` remains on the container as a rollback path for the live-config fix, consistent with the prior session's backup convention; not pruned this session.
- Remote branch deletion (`git push origin --delete`) is not force-reversible via git alone, but both branches' content is confirmed present on `main` via merged PRs #196/#197, and GitHub retains deleted-branch commit history for a period via reflog/PR references if ever needed.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not re-open the broader `LAB_*` → `LABBY_*` rename audit to search for other possible config-as-data references beyond `bearer_token_env`/`client_secret_env` — a full-file grep for any `*_env = ` field confirmed these were the only two field types in `config.toml`, so a broader audit was judged unnecessary.
- Did not sync the `marketplace-no-mcp` branch/worktree (350 commits behind `origin/marketplace-no-mcp`) — out of scope for this session's "land everything on main" request, which was interpreted as the `main` branch specifically, and the branch is explicitly protected from casual sync/merge per this repo's `CLAUDE.md`.

## Open Questions

- Whether any other Labby deployment (if one exists beyond this single container) has the same stale `config.toml` env var reference issue was not investigated — this session only touched the one live container reachable at `labby.tootie.tv`.

## Next Steps

- No unfinished work from this session. The live container's `config.toml` is now fully consistent with its `.env` file, all tested upstreams are healthy or in an expected OAuth-reauth state, `main` is fully landed and in sync with `origin/main`, and stale branches are cleaned up.
- If a similar rename or config-value migration is done again in the future, extend the verification pass to include live per-upstream `gateway.test` calls (not just `gateway.list`) to catch this class of gap earlier.
