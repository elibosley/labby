## User Request

User shared a screenshot of the "Add Gateway" dialog and reported that half the service icons were barely visible: "you need to make these images look correct... half of them are barely visible..."

## Session Overview

Fixed icon contrast in the `ServiceIconBox` component of `gateway-form-dialog.tsx`. The root cause was that selfhst/icons PNG logos use each service's own brand colors — placing them on a background filled with the same brand color made them nearly invisible. Solution: white icon well with a 2px brand-colored border and a subtle outer glow. SVG fallbacks and letter avatars were also updated to use the brand color on white instead of white-on-dark.

## Sequence of Events

1. User provided screenshot showing many service logos barely visible against dark brand-colored icon backgrounds.
2. Diagnosed root cause: `ServiceIconBox` used `background: ${brand}CC` — the logo and its background shared the same hue, killing contrast.
3. Changed icon box to `background: #ffffff` with `border: 2px solid ${brand}` and `box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px ${brand}33`.
4. Updated SVG fallback rendering: replaced `fill="white"` with `fill="${brand}"` so fallback icons are visible on white background.
5. Updated letter avatar fallback from `text-white` to `style={{ color: brand }}` for consistency.
6. Navigated to `http://192.0.2.6:3002` (dev server on port 3002, not 3000).
7. Injected a DOM overlay with all 20 service icons using the new white-background style.
8. Waited 2 seconds for CDN images to load, then screenshotted — all 20 logos sharp and fully visible.
9. Removed test overlay.

## Key Findings

- `gateway-form-dialog.tsx:109` — original style `background: ${brand}CC; border: 1px solid ${brand}` caused brand-on-brand invisibility for dark services (UniFi `#0559C9`, Linkding `#7C5CBF`, Memos `#3478F6`, Gotify `#45AEE5`, exampledownload `#2F99E0`).
- Dev server was running on port **3002**, not 3000 — `ss -tlnp` confirmed this.
- The selfhst/icons PNGs are full-color images designed for light/white backgrounds, not dark brand-colored backgrounds.
- SVG fallbacks had `fill="white"` hardcoded — would have been invisible on white background without the inline replace.

## Technical Decisions

- **White background, brand border** over brand-fill background: selfhst PNGs use real app colors; white gives every logo maximum contrast regardless of color palette. This matches how Homarr, Dashdot, and most homelab dashboards render service icons.
- **`box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px ${brand}33`** as outer glow: adds subtle depth and reinforces brand identity without overpowering the icon. The `33` alpha (20%) keeps it subtle against the dark dialog background.
- **Inline `.replace('fill="white"', fill="${brand}")`** for SVG fallbacks: avoids a full SVG re-parse while correctly switching from white-on-dark to brand-on-white.
- **`border: 2px solid`** (thicker than original 1px): white background needs a more assertive border to visually anchor the icon box against the dark dialog background.

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `apps/gateway-admin/components/gateway/gateway-form-dialog.tsx` | `ServiceIconBox`: white bg, brand border, brand-colored SVG fallbacks and letter avatars |

## Commands Executed

```bash
# Confirm dev server port
ss -tlnp | grep -E '3000|3001|3002'
# → LISTEN on 0.0.0.0:3002

# DOM overlay injection + screenshot (Chrome DevTools MCP)
# Injected 20 service icons with new white-bg style, waited 2s, screenshotted
```

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Icon box background | `${brand}CC` (semi-transparent brand color) | `#ffffff` (white) |
| Icon box border | `1px solid ${brand}` | `2px solid ${brand}` + `box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px ${brand}33` |
| SVG fallback fill | `fill="white"` (invisible on white) | `fill="${brand}"` (brand-colored on white) |
| Letter avatar color | `text-white` (invisible on white) | `color: brand` (brand-colored on white) |
| Dark-brand logos (UniFi, Linkding, etc.) | Nearly invisible | Fully visible |

## Verification Evidence

| Action | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Screenshot of 20-icon overlay | All logos sharp and visible | All 20 logos fully visible, crisp | ✅ |
| UniFi (`#0559C9`) on white bg | Logo visible | Visible | ✅ |
| Linkding (`#7C5CBF`) on white bg | Logo visible | Visible | ✅ |

## Next Steps

### Follow-on
- Commit already landed as `fca019b fix(gateway-admin): brand icon white bg + colored border for contrast — v0.7.2`.
- Consider applying the same white-bg pattern to any other places in the UI that render service icons (e.g., gateway list, registry server cards) for visual consistency.
