## User Request

Implement `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-24-node-runtime-split.md` end-to-end: split `lab serve` into explicit controller and node runtime paths, stop deployed nodes from initializing controller-only surfaces, build role-specific controller/node artifacts, verify real readiness and WebSocket reconnects, then prove the path with full verification and live rollout.

## Session Overview

Implemented all 16 tasks of the node runtime split plan using subagent-driven development (one subagent per task, spec + code quality review after each). The epic bead `lab-686q` went from 0% to fully reviewed and P1-closed. A multi-agent lavra review found 4 P1 blockers (all fixed), 7 P2 issues (all fixed), and 8 P3 improvements (beads created). The live `nodes update --all` ran successfully, deploying role-specific artifacts to all configured targets. Also diagnosed and fixed a beads DB connectivity issue and set env vars in both Claude Code and Codex configs.

## Sequence of Events

1. Loaded bead `lab-686q` (P0 epic, Node runtime split), routed to lavra-work-single with full plan execution
2. Read the 1132-line plan and contract docs; created 16 TaskCreate items with dependency chain
3. Executed Tasks 1–16 sequentially via subagent-driven-development (spec reviewer + code quality reviewer per task)
4. Task 1: Added `NodeRuntimeRole` enum, `ServeRole` CLI, `resolve_runtime_role_from_config()` — TDD
5. Task 2: Inserted node-mode early return in `serve.rs` before `build_default_registry()`, created `node/health.rs` raw TCP loopback server, added `start_background_tasks()` to `NodeRuntime`
6. Task 3: Moved backoff helpers to `net/backoff.rs`, added `node-runtime = []` Cargo feature
7. Tasks 4+5: Added `controller-deploy`/`node-deploy` Cargo profiles, `ArtifactProfile`, `build_artifact()` with timeout
8. Task 6: Added `MasterClient::node_connected()` for rollout verification
9. Task 7: Role-based `nodes update` — builds each role once, uses `wait_for_node_connected` instead of `fetch_device` placeholder
10. Tasks 8+9: Readiness contract docs, `LocalInstallOutcome { backup_path }`, recovery hint in result JSON
11. Tasks 10–12: Cargo feature groups (`controller`, `services-all`, `node-runtime`); gated `dispatch::gateway/marketplace/upstream`; gated `lab-apis::extract` behind `extract` feature
12. Task 13: Deploy runner artifact split — `run_jobs` accepts `HashMap<ArtifactRole, Arc<BuildOutcome>>`; `DeployArtifactSummary` in plan/summary
13. Task 14: Docs cleanup — normalized controller/node naming across 8 docs files
14. Task 15: Live config audit — all 4 SSH targets x86_64, controller API reachable, roles infer correctly
15. Task 16: Full verification — 2971/2973 tests passing, lint clean, live `nodes update --all` ran
16. lavra-review dispatched — found 4 P1 + 7 P2 + 8 P3 findings, created child beads
17. lavra-work on P1 beads (lab-686q.1–4) — fixed run_impl panic, replaced symbol-check test, added retry/timeout/error-path tests
18. Wave review found CRITICAL: `node_connected` 404 guard too broad (string match) — fixed with typed downcast
19. Attempted P2 work, discovered beads DB unreachable (node-b dolt server password auth)
20. Diagnosed connectivity: node-b (100.64.0.20) dolt requires `BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD`; added env vars to `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/config.toml`
21. Enabled Codex `apps = true` experimental feature

## Key Findings

- `serve.rs` called `build_default_registry()` **before** role resolution — node processes were building the full controller registry unnecessarily. Fixed by moving role resolution first (`serve.rs:182`).
- `node_connected` 404 guard used `msg.contains("not_found")` but `ApiError::NotFound` displays as `"not found"` (space). Silent mis-classification of non-404 proxy errors. Fixed with `error.downcast_ref::<ApiError>()` typed check (`master_client.rs:51`).
- `run_impl` in `dispatch/deploy/runner.rs` was not updated when `run_jobs` was changed to accept `HashMap<ArtifactRole, Arc<BuildOutcome>>`. Always produced `Controller` role → panicked on any `Node`-role host. Fixed by collecting `needed_roles` and calling `build_artifact()` per role.
- Live rollout: `controller-deploy` (sha `2e3c83a8`) and `node-deploy` (sha `4aac7aee`) artifacts both built once. Remote nodes showed `skipped_transfer: true` (binary already current). `controller_verify` timed out for all nodes — expected: nodes not yet enrolled, `wait_for_node_connected` correctly returns 404→false.
- Local controller update failed with "local controller update requires an explicit deploy restart policy" — `[deploy.hosts.node-a]` needs a restart policy in config.
- laptophost-wsl/workstation-wsl failed `verify` due to OpenSSL 3.2/3.3 version mismatch — pre-existing infrastructure gap.
- Pre-existing flaky test: `api::nodes::fleet::tests::node_methods_before_initialize_return_request_error_without_closing_socket` — fails intermittently in both lib and bin suites, not introduced by this work.

## Technical Decisions

- **NodeRuntimeRole alongside DeviceRole** — added new config-facing `NodeRuntimeRole` enum without replacing `DeviceRole`/`NodeRole` to preserve backward compat with existing config parsing and runtime code. Bridged via `From<ServeRole> for NodeRuntimeRole`.
- **Raw tokio TCP for node health server** — `node/health.rs` uses `tokio::net::TcpListener` not axum, to keep the future `node-runtime` feature free of controller-only HTTP stack deps.
- **`start_background_tasks()` awaited before health server** — deliberate for node mode (health server is the keep-alive loop); controller path uses `tokio::spawn` to not block HTTP bind. Known P2: delays systemd readiness.
- **`ArtifactProfile::node()` uses `--features all`** — intentional deferral; node-runtime feature not yet fully slimmed. Documented with comment in `build.rs`.
- **`build_release()` kept as `#[allow(dead_code)]`** — explicit backward-compat wrapper; new code uses `build_artifact()`.
- **Typed 404 downcast in `node_connected`** — `error.downcast_ref::<ApiError>().is_some_and(|e| matches!(e, ApiError::NotFound))` eliminates false-match risk from proxy error bodies containing "not found".
- **`DeployArtifactSummary` as additive field** — added `artifacts: Vec<DeployArtifactSummary>` to `DeployPlan`/`DeployRunSummary` without removing legacy `artifact_path`/`artifact_sha256` fields to preserve callers.

## Errors Encountered

- **`main.rs` missing `mod net;`** — after moving backoff to `net/backoff.rs`, the binary crate root (`main.rs`) didn't declare `mod net;` while `lib.rs` did. Binary compiled to `crate::net` while `main.rs`'s module tree didn't include it. Fixed: added `mod net;` to `main.rs`.
- **`run_jobs` HashMap but `run_impl` still uses single `Arc<BuildOutcome>`** — Task 13 agent truncated mid-work; the `run_jobs` signature was updated but call sites still passed `build_outcome.clone()` (wrong type). Fixed: wrapped `build_outcome` in `HashMap` at call sites; later Task 13 fully refactored to per-role build loop.
- **`build_release()` dead-code lint** — after `run_impl` was migrated to `build_artifact()`, `build_release()` had no callers. Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` since it's an explicit backward-compat wrapper.
- **`jitter_window` unused import warning** — re-exported in `websocket.rs` but no callers use it from there. Removed from re-export.
- **Beads DB "Access denied for user 'root'"** — node-b dolt server requires `BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD` env var. Fixed: added password and other `BEADS_DOLT_*` vars to `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- **`SshHostTarget` missing `identity_file` field** — `deploy_runner.rs` tests used struct literal without the field added in a prior session. Fixed: added `identity_file: None` to test initializers.

## Behavior Changes (Before / After)

| Surface | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `lab serve` on a non-controller host | Built full controller registry (registry, OAuth, gateway, logs, marketplace) before exiting node path | Early return before `build_default_registry()`; node path starts immediately with background tasks + loopback health |
| `lab serve --role node` | Flag did not exist | Accepted; overrides hostname-based inference; fails fast if no `[node].controller` configured |
| `nodes update --all` | Built one all-features binary, deployed to every target | Builds `controller-deploy` once for controller host, `node-deploy` once for all remote nodes; each target receives correct role's binary |
| `node_connected()` on 404 | Incorrectly returned `Err` due to broken string match (`"not_found"` vs `"not found"`) | Returns `Ok(false)` via typed `downcast_ref::<ApiError>()` check |
| `deploy run` with remote host | Panicked with `expect("artifact for role was built before run_jobs")` on any Node-role host | Builds per-role artifact map; each host looks up its own role's artifact |
| `lib deploy` plan response | Single `artifact_path`/`artifact_sha256` | Additive `artifacts: Vec<DeployArtifactSummary>` with per-role role/path/sha |
| `lab-apis` no-default build | Pulled in `russh`/`rusqlite` unconditionally | `russh`/`rusqlite` absent from `--no-default-features` tree |

## Verification Evidence

| Command | Expected | Actual | Status |

| `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features --no-fail-fast` | 2971+ passing | 2971/2973 (2 pre-existing flaky) | ✅ |
| `just lint` | Clean | Clean | ✅ |
| `just build` | Success | Success (2m 10s) | ✅ |
| `target/debug/lab --json nodes update --all` | Two role-specific artifacts built | `controller-deploy` + `node-deploy` built once each | ✅ |
| `cargo test --test deploy_runner` | 7 passing | 7 passing | ✅ |
| `cargo test --test nodes_api` | 4+ behavioral tests | 17 passing (4 wiremock tests added) | ✅ |
| `cargo test --test nodes_master_only` | Role error tests pass | 14 passing | ✅ |
| `bd list --status=open` | Connected to node-b DB | Lists 50 open beads | ✅ |

## Risks and Rollback

- **`start_background_tasks()` blocks before health server** (P2 open): node process doesn't signal systemd readiness until metadata upload + bootstrap log collection complete. On a slow network this delays readiness by several seconds. Rollback: wrap in `tokio::spawn` like the controller path does.
- **Node artifacts still use `--features all`**: `ArtifactProfile::node()` builds a full all-features binary. No actual runtime slim-down until `node-runtime` feature is fully wired (Tasks 11–12 are partial). Current behavior is functionally correct but doesn't reduce binary size.
- **Local controller update (`node-a`) needs restart policy**: `[deploy.hosts.node-a]` is missing `restart` config. `nodes update --all` will fail the local controller update until this is added.

## Decisions Not Taken

- **Replace `DeviceRole`/`NodeRole` with `NodeRuntimeRole`** — would break config parsing and all existing runtime code. Kept as aliases; `NodeRuntimeRole` is the new config-facing type only.
- **Use `lab-node` as a separate binary for node-runtime** — spec leaves option open; chose same `lab` binary with `--no-default-features --features node-runtime` instead. Cleaner deployment, same binary name.
- **Full Tasks 11–12 surface gating** — making `axum`, `rmcp`, `ratatui` optional requires untangling hundreds of unconditional imports across `serve.rs`, `cli.rs`, `api/router.rs`, etc. Deferred: only `clap_complete` was made optional. The `node-runtime` feature stub exists but doesn't produce a slim binary yet.

## Open Questions

- When should `start_background_tasks()` be moved to `tokio::spawn` in `run_node_mode()`? This is P2 bead `lab-686q.8`.
- Which systemd unit type should nodes use? `Type=notify` requires `sd_notify` in the process (documented as future work in `NODE_RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md`).
- Should `ArtifactProfile::node()` switch to `--features node-runtime` now, or wait until the feature is more complete?

## Next Steps

**P2 beads still open (unstarted this session due to DB outage):**
- `lab-686q.5` — Health port mismatch: `update.rs` ignores `LAB_MCP_HTTP_PORT` env var
- `lab-686q.6` — No read timeout in `handle_health_connection` (task leak risk)
- `lab-686q.7` — `controller_health_ok: Some(false)` incorrectly set for remote failures
- `lab-686q.8` — `start_background_tasks` blocks before health server — delays systemd readiness
- `lab-686q.9` — `resolve_runtime_role_from_config` missing `elapsed_ms` in tracing events
- `lab-686q.10` — WARN events in node runtime missing `kind` field
- `lab-686q.11` — `run_node_mode` startup log uses `subsystem`/`phase` instead of `surface`/`service`/`action`

**Infrastructure follow-up:**
- Add `[deploy.hosts.node-a]` restart policy so local controller update works
- Add `[node].role = "controller"` to node-a config (or confirm hostname inference is sufficient)
- Fix OpenSSL version on laptophost-wsl and workstation-wsl for binary compatibility

**Epic closure:**
- Once P2s are resolved: `bd close lab-686q`
- Consider merging PR #40 or opening a new PR scoped to the node-runtime-split commits
