# Labby connector investigation and MCP server identity fix

## User Request

"Is labby currently running rn? can you check the latest logs" — followed by "why is it that I complete the oauth flow for labby in claude desktop and it opens claude desktop back up and then just doesnt connect to labby and gives no error or anything", a full-journal log sweep, and applying the `serverInfo` fix with quick-push + merge + deploy to the Incus container.

## Session Overview

Confirmed labby is healthy in the `labby` Incus container, root-caused the "Claude Desktop won't connect after OAuth" symptom to client-side UI state (every server-side step provably succeeds), swept the entire journal (Jun 29 → now) with a categorized census, and fixed the MCP server identity bug where `get_info()` advertised rmcp's crate defaults (`rmcp 2.1.0`) instead of `labby` + workspace version. Quick-push in progress at doc-write time: branch `fix/mcp-server-identity` cut from origin/main at the v1.5.0 release commit; PR, merge, release build, and Incus deploy follow this document in the same session.

## Sequence of Events

1. **Status check.** Found labby running as a systemd unit inside the `labby` Incus container (not host systemd); pulled latest journal; service active since Jul 16 21:44:46 UTC.
2. **Connector investigation.** Traced the user's three OAuth attempts (02:19:03, 02:19:31, 02:59:34 UTC): each completed DCR → Google → code exchange → token mint → claude.ai backend verification sync (initialize + tools/list) within ~1s. Zero failing requests.
3. **Deploy correlation chase.** Binary replaced at 21:44 (dev build reporting 1.4.1); ruled it out — tool list (15 tools, `upstream_ui_tool_count=14`), capabilities, and MCP Apps advertisement identical before/after the deploy.
4. **Live-traffic proof.** Found claude.ai serving the user's quick-shell MCP App widget through the connector at 02:09–02:11 and `open_quick_shell` succeeding at 02:18:14 — 49 seconds before the first re-auth. Conclusion: Desktop UI state issue, not labby.
5. **Full log sweep.** Journal extent Jun 29 → now (143k lines): zero ERRORs since restart, all warning families categorized and dated, no crashes/OOM kills (host kernel + container checked).
6. **serverInfo fix.** A read-only side-chat fork pinned the bug; applied in main session under bead lab-3o0sc: `get_info()` now sets `Implementation::new("labby", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))`, test assertions added, verified with nextest + `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo check --all-targets --all-features`.
7. **Quick-push start.** Branch `fix/mcp-server-identity` created from origin/main@05219b5f (v1.5.0 release); version bump + changelog deliberately skipped (release-please owns both). PR/merge/deploy pending at doc-write time.

## Key Findings

- `crates/labby/src/mcp/server.rs:180` — `ServerInfo::new(builder.build())` left `server_info` at rmcp defaults; live gateway confirmed returning `{"name":"rmcp","version":"2.1.0"}` on initialize.
- The claude.ai connector (`https://dinglebear.ai/mcp`, route `dinglebear-root`, issuer `https://mcp.dinglebear.ai`) is server-side healthy: backend syncs (initialize/tools/resources/prompts) succeed repeatedly; established registrations refresh tokens on schedule.
- claude.ai POST-only syncs are health polls; real chat usage appears as `method=GET` SSE streams. Zero GETs after the 21:44 restart = no chat re-engaged, not a transport failure.
- `WARN destructive action elicitation not supported` (392 total, all since Jul 16's destructive-gate change) is **non-blocking**: warned calls proceed to `upstream proxy ok`. Policy note: destructive-annotated widget callbacks (e.g. `write_quick_shell_input` — typing into a shell on the gateway host) execute with WARN-only for non-elicitation clients like claude.ai.
- Five gateway upstreams stuck in `oauth_needs_reauth` (google-calendar/drive/gmail/people ~4 days expired; globalping ~3 weeks) generate ~95% of journal warning noise.
- Historical-only noise: log-ingest queue drops (9.6k, Jun 29–Jul 04), DCR redirect rejections (327, mostly Jul 06–07, old `chat.openai.com` callback), all ERROR categories (read-only fs from CI image, port 8765 conflicts, wrong-home logs.db, marketplace sync).

## Technical Decisions

- Fully-qualified `rmcp::model::Implementation::new(...)` in `get_info` rather than promoting the import — the existing `use rmcp::model::Implementation` is scoped to a nested test module; minimal churn.
- Assertions added to the existing `server_capabilities_advertise_list_changed_support` test instead of a new test fn — the test already exercises `get_info()`.
- Skipped manual version bump + CHANGELOG entry: release-please owns `[workspace.package] version` and CHANGELOG.md from Conventional Commits; the `fix:` commit feeds the next release PR.
- Branch cut from origin/main@05219b5f (v1.5.0) rather than stale local main (ae8dfbeb, 1 behind) so the deployed binary self-reports 1.5.0.

## Files Changed

| status | path | previous path | purpose | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| modified | `crates/labby/src/mcp/server.rs` | — | Set MCP server identity to labby + crate version; assert in test | `git status`: ` M crates/labby/src/mcp/server.rs`; test PASS |
| created | `docs/sessions/2026-07-16-labby-connector-investigation-and-server-identity-fix.md` | — | This session log | this file |

Out-of-repo: wrote agent memory `~/.claude/projects/-home-jmagar-workspace-lab/memory/labby_incus_deployment.md` (+ MEMORY.md index line) documenting the Incus deployment layout and dinglebear connector route.

## Beads Activity

| bead | title | actions | final status | why it mattered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| lab-3o0sc | Set labby MCP serverInfo instead of rmcp default | created → claimed → closed | closed | Tracked the server-identity fix per repo workflow; closed with verification evidence |

`bd` commands emitted `[mysql] i/o timeout` auto-backup warnings (known edgehost dolt sync flakiness); operations themselves succeeded.

## Repository Maintenance

- **Plans**: `docs/plans/fleet-ws-plan-lab-n07n.md` status unclear — not moved (quick-push constrains to read-only maintenance). `docs/plans/complete/` already holds the completed OAuth proxy plan.
- **Beads**: lab-3o0sc fully lifecycle-managed this session (see above). No follow-up beads created — remaining work (PR merge + deploy) executes immediately after this doc in the same session.
- **Worktrees/branches**: `marketplace-no-mcp` worktree (behind 3) left alone — protected long-lived variant branch per root CLAUDE.md. Local `main` 1 behind origin — updated as part of the merge flow after this doc.
- **Stale docs**: none found contradicted by this session's findings; deployment knowledge captured in agent memory instead (not a repo doc concern).
- **Transparency**: no files moved, no branches deleted, no docs rewritten during this pass.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Shell (Bash)**: incus exec/file pull, journalctl analysis pipelines, curl MCP handshakes, cargo nextest/check, git/gh, bd. Issues: no `jq` inside the labby container (worked around with `incus file pull`); `journalctl -k` on host returned only the oomd socket line (sufficient for the OOM check).
- **File tools (Read/Edit/Write)**: source verification and the two-part fix in `server.rs`; memory files; this doc.
- **Skills**: `vibin:quick-push` (this flow), `vibin:save-to-md` (this doc).
- **Session MCP tools**: `spawn_task` (serverInfo chip, later superseded) and `dismiss_task` (already dismissed user-side).
- **Subagents**: none in-session; a read-only side-chat fork (separate session) contributed the paste-ready patch recon.
- **Python**: jsonschema Draft 2020-12 validation of all 16 served tool schemas — all valid.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `incus exec labby -- systemctl status labby` | active (running) since Jul 16 21:44:46 UTC |
| `incus exec labby -- journalctl -u labby …` (many filters) | full investigation evidence; 0 ERRORs since restart |
| curl initialize/tools-list against `127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` (in container) | `serverInfo {"name":"rmcp","version":"2.1.0"}` pre-fix; 16 tools dumped |
| `cargo nextest run -p labby --all-features server_capabilities_advertise` | 1 passed |
| `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo check --all-targets --all-features` | clean, 1m53s |
| `bd create/update/close lab-3o0sc` | bead lifecycle complete |
| `git checkout -b fix/mcp-server-identity origin/main` | branch at 05219b5f with fix carried |

## Errors Encountered

- `cargo nextest … get_info` matched 0 tests — test fn is `server_capabilities_advertise_list_changed_support`; re-ran with correct filter.
- `jq: not found` in the labby container — pulled `/tmp/tools.json` to host scratchpad and analyzed there.
- Dolt auto-backup `i/o timeout` warnings on every `bd` call — known edgehost sync flakiness, non-blocking.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| MCP initialize response | `serverInfo: {"name":"rmcp","version":"2.1.0"}` | `serverInfo: {"name":"labby","version":"<workspace version>"}` (live after next container deploy) |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo nextest run -p labby --all-features server_capabilities_advertise` | pass with new serverInfo assertions | 1 passed | pass |
| `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo check --all-targets --all-features` | no warnings | Finished clean 1m53s | pass |
| `rg 'server_info' crates/` | no other assertions on old identity | only `src/mcp/server.rs` | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- Trivial blast radius: two-line identity change; capabilities untouched (test asserts them). Rollback = revert the commit and redeploy prior binary.
- The Incus deploy restarts `labby.service`, dropping live MCP sessions (claude.ai/ChatGPT clients re-initialize on next use — same as every prior deploy).

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not gate or change the destructive widget-callback WARN-only policy — flagged to Jacob as a conscious-decision item, not changed unilaterally.
- Did not manually bump version/CHANGELOG (release-please contract).

## Open Questions

- Does claude.ai **web** Settings → Connectors show the dinglebear connector as Connected while Desktop shows nothing? (Splits the remaining Desktop-UI ambiguity; not checkable server-side.)
- Is WARN-only execution of destructive-annotated widget callbacks (`write_quick_shell_input`) the intended policy for non-elicitation clients?

## Next Steps

1. **This session (in flight)**: commit + push `fix/mcp-server-identity`, open PR, merge to main, `cargo build --workspace --all-features --release`, push binary into the `labby` Incus container (stop → swap → start), verify `labby --version` + live initialize `serverInfo`, tag `labby-incus-<sha>`.
2. Re-authorize the 5 expired gateway upstreams (google-calendar, google-drive, google-gmail, google-people, globalping) to kill the warning spam.
3. In Claude Desktop: fully quit + relaunch; check claude.ai web connector state; remove duplicate dinglebear connector entries if present.
4. Decide the destructive widget-callback elicitation policy (Open Questions).
