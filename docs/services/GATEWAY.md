# Gateway Management

`lab` exposes a first-class `gateway` management surface for the upstream MCP proxy defined in [UPSTREAM.md](./UPSTREAM.md).

The `gateway` service owns upstream MCP configuration and runtime reconciliation. It does not own unrelated host identity or orchestration concerns.

Use it when you want to inspect, test, add, update, remove, or reload `[[upstream]]` entries without editing `~/.config/labby/config.toml` by hand.

## Scope

- `[[upstream]]` in `~/.config/labby/config.toml` remains the persisted source of truth.
- `gateway.*` actions mutate that config, reconcile runtime state, and trigger MCP list-changed notifications when the merged catalog changes.
- In-flight MCP requests keep using the pool they already captured. New requests observe the swapped pool after reconcile completes.
- gateway management is exposed by the running Labby gateway host through CLI, MCP, API, and web surfaces

Secrets remain indirect:

- config and management responses may include `bearer_token_env`
- token values are never returned
- token values are never written into TOML
- changing an env var alone does not hot-apply; call `gateway.reload`
- tool exposure filters are stored as names/patterns only; the gateway never rewrites upstream tool payloads

## Actions

The complete gateway action inventory is generated from `ActionSpec`:

- [generated action catalog](../generated/action-catalog.md)
- [generated action catalog JSON](../generated/action-catalog.json)

Lab uses `destructive` only for actions that can permanently lose data that
cannot be quickly and easily regenerated with minimal effort. Reversible gateway
lifecycle work is still admin-gated, but it is not destructive under that
definition. In particular, clearing OAuth tokens, enabling/disabling an
upstream, and killing restartable upstream processes do not require destructive
confirmation.

### Stdio Gateways

Stdio upstreams run a configured command on the local host running `lab` when
they are tested or reconciled. This is an admin-gated execution path, but it is
not marked destructive unless the action risks permanent, hard-to-recreate data
loss.

#### Spawn Guard

The gateway validates that the `command` basename of any stdio upstream is in a
built-in allowlist (`npx`, `uvx`, `docker`, `node`, `bun`, `python`, `python3`,
`deno`, `pipx`, `dnx`, `ssh`) before writing the config. SSH can therefore be
used directly as a stdio transport for MCP services that speak MCP over a
remote command. `[gateway]` knobs in `config.toml` control this:

```toml
[[upstream]]
name = "remote-mcp"
transport = "stdio"
command = "/usr/bin/ssh"
args = ["-o", "BatchMode=yes", "-o", "ConnectTimeout=10", "user@example.test", "/usr/local/bin/remote-mcp", "mcp"]
```

```toml
[gateway]
# Allow additional binaries beyond the built-in list. An entry may be a bare
# binary name, which matches that basename at any path ("myserver" allows
# /usr/local/bin/myserver), or a full command path, which matches only that
# exact command ("/opt/tools/myserver" does not allow /tmp/myserver).
extra_stdio_commands = ["myserver", "/opt/tools/pinned-server"]

# Or disable the guard entirely (operator takes full responsibility).
disable_spawn_guard = true

# Periodically reconnect enabled upstreams whose MCP transport closes.
# Recovery is opt-in because stdio recovery can restart child processes.
auto_reconnect = true
```

The guard applies only to stdio upstreams. HTTP upstreams are never checked.
See [`docs/runtime/CONFIG.md`](../runtime/CONFIG.md) for the full `[gateway]`
config reference.

## Tool, Resource, and Prompt Exposure

Gateway config can optionally restrict which discovered upstream primitives are
republished by `lab`, via `expose_tools`, `expose_resources`, and
`expose_prompts`.

- when an allowlist is unset, everything discovered for that capability remains exposed
- allowlists accept exact names and simple `*` wildcards
- an empty allowlist blocks everything for that capability. To clear a filter and
  go back to exposing everything, set it to `null` (omit the key in
  `config.toml`, or send `null` in a `gateway.update` patch) — not `[]`
- filtered items disappear from the merged MCP listing **and** cannot be reached
  directly through the proxy — `tools/call`, `resources/read`, `prompts/get`, and
  `completion/complete` all re-check the allowlist, on the shared, OAuth
  subject-scoped, and relay paths alike

`expose_resources` matches the bare upstream resource URI (not the
`lab://upstream/{name}/…` rewrite); `expose_prompts` matches either the bare
prompt name or the `{upstream}/{name}` form the admin UI displays. See
[`docs/services/UPSTREAM.md`](UPSTREAM.md#exposure-filtering) for details.

Example:

```toml
[[upstream]]
name = "github"
url = "https://github.example.com/mcp"
bearer_token_env = "GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN"
proxy_resources = false
expose_tools = ["search_repos", "github_*"]
expose_resources = ["repo://github/readme"]
expose_prompts = ["review_pr"]
```

Typical patch payloads:

```json
{ "action": "gateway.update", "params": { "name": "github", "patch": { "expose_tools": ["search_repos", "github_*"] } } }
```

```json
{ "action": "gateway.update", "params": { "name": "github", "patch": { "expose_tools": null } } }
```

## Agent Skills and Loadouts

Agent Skills over MCP and reusable protected-route Loadouts are first-class Gateway control-plane surfaces. See [Agent Skills and Loadouts](../guides/SKILLS_AND_LOADOUTS.md) for the trust model, exposure semantics, CLI/API actions, route projection rules, graceful degradation, observability, WebUI behavior, and verification commands.

## Gateway Code Mode

When enabled, Lab hides raw proxied upstream tools from MCP `list_tools()` and exposes
the single synthetic `codemode` gateway tool:

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|------|
| `codemode` | Run one JavaScript async arrow function in the Code Mode sandbox. Use `codemode.search()` and `codemode.describe()` inside the same execution to discover upstream tools, then call them through generated helpers or `callTool(id, params)`. | Primary |

This keeps the MCP catalog small while still allowing clients to reach every exposed upstream tool.
Per-upstream `expose_tools` filters still apply before tools enter the searchable catalog.

Configuration lives at root `[code_mode]` in `config.toml`:

```toml
[code_mode]
enabled = true
trace_params = true
result_shape_policy = "off"
timeout_ms = 30000
max_response_bytes = 24576
max_response_tokens = 6000
token_estimate_divisor = 4
max_log_entries = 1000
max_log_bytes = 65536
```

CLI:

```bash
labby gateway code status
labby gateway code enable
labby gateway code disable
labby gateway code exec --code 'async () => (await codemode.search("GitHub issues")).total'
```

HTTP/MCP gateway management actions:

```json
{ "action": "gateway.code_mode.get", "params": {} }
```

```json
{ "action": "gateway.code_mode.set", "params": { "enabled": true, "trace_params": true, "result_shape_policy": "truncate", "timeout_ms": 5000, "max_log_entries": 100 } }
```

MCP `codemode` call shape:

```json
{ "code": "async () => { const matches = await codemode.search(\"github issues\"); const docs = await codemode.describe(matches.results[0].path); return { docs, issues: await codemode.github.search_issues({ q: \"repo:dinglebear-ai/labby gateway\" }) }; }" }
```

Execution runs in a short-lived child process with an embedded JavaScript engine.
The child gets an empty environment, a temporary working directory, no Node/Deno
host APIs, and no direct access to the Lab runtime. The only host capability is
the injected `codemode.<upstream>.<tool>()` typed helpers and the escape-hatch
`callTool(id, params)` function, which sends each requested call back to the
parent gateway for normal visibility, scope, destructive-action, and upstream
exposure checks. `params` must be JSON-serializable.

### Code Mode Call Inspector

When Code Mode is enabled, the synthetic MCP `codemode` tool advertises a
read-only MCP App inspector through `_meta.ui.resourceUri`.

- `codemode` attaches `ui://lab/code-mode/codemode`
- recent in-memory history is available at `ui://lab/code-mode/history`

The inspector is passive observability only. It renders tool-result
`structuredContent` and recent server-injected history snapshots; it does not
initiate tool calls, call Lab HTTP APIs, or execute app-originated operations in
v1. The `ui://` resource body is self-contained HTML so MCP hosts do not need to
resolve exported Next.js chunk assets from the resource body. The Next route in
`apps/gateway-admin/app/mcp/code-mode/` remains available for browser/static
build verification.

`codemode` emits a runtime trace (`code_mode_execute_trace`) from the broker's
actual upstream calls, including upstream, tool, status, elapsed time, error
kind, compact result shape, and optional params. In-sandbox
`codemode.search()` and `codemode.describe()` are discovery helpers, not
separate MCP tools or separate structured trace kinds.

Trace params are redacted and capped before leaving the broker boundary. Raw
params are consumed only for upstream dispatch; they must not enter public
response structs, structured content, history, resources, logs, UI state, or
tests. Set `code_mode.trace_params = false` to omit params from traces entirely.
History is process-local, memory-only, maintained under entry/byte caps on a
best-effort basis, and cleared on restart; do not treat it as a durable audit log
or a hard storage quota until the backend history-cap follow-up lands.

### Labby MCP App Manager

Root-gateway clients with `lab` or `lab:admin` also receive the always-on
`mcp_app` tool bound to `ui://lab/apps/manage`. Its UI is the recovery
switchboard for Labby's own app surfaces: Code Mode Inspector, Gateway Status,
Server Logs, and Add Server. Status reads require `lab` or `lab:admin`;
enable/disable mutations require `lab:admin`. The `mcp_app` control tool is
intentionally omitted from protected subset routes. Its own manager UI can be
disabled, but the text-only control tool remains available on the root gateway.

The Code Mode Inspector keeps its compatibility switch at
`code_mode.mcp_ui_enabled`. The other visibility switches are
`mcp_apps.manager`, `mcp_apps.gateway_status`, `mcp_apps.server_logs`,
`mcp_apps.add_server`, and `mcp_apps.settings`. Every Labby-owned app surface
defaults to `false` and must be explicitly enabled. The `mcp_app` control tool
remains available without UI metadata so an administrator can inspect or restore
any app, including its own manager UI. App-only mutations persist without
rebuilding the upstream pool and publish both tool and resource list-changed
notifications. Upstream MCP Apps are not governed by these switches. Their app
tools/callbacks pass through only when an allowed upstream exposes a real
resource-backed app owner, `proxy_resources` is enabled, and the bound `ui://`
URI passes `expose_resources`. Callback markers without such an owner and
ambiguous tool names fail closed. Destructive app tools require execute scope,
and OAuth app resources remain subject-bound on read.

### Add Server MCP App

When `mcp_apps.add_server = true`, admin-capable MCP Apps hosts may also
receive a synthetic `add_server` tool bound to `ui://lab/gateway/add-server`.
Calling the tool with no arguments opens a responsive form for a server name and
either an HTTP endpoint or local stdio command. The app auto-detects the
transport, can probe the proposed server, and can add it to the gateway catalog
while controlling resource and prompt exposure.

The app callbacks remain thin MCP adapters: `test` delegates to
`gateway.test`, and `create` delegates to `gateway.add`. The tool and resource
require `lab:admin`; they are omitted from lower-scope catalogs.

### Gateway Status MCP App

When `mcp_apps.gateway_status = true`, admin-capable MCP Apps hosts may also
receive a synthetic `gateway_status` tool bound to `ui://lab/gateway/status`.
Calling it opens a responsive, read-only snapshot of connected upstreams, their
exposed capability counts, transport, and warnings. Its `refresh` callback
delegates to `gateway.list`, and late launch output cannot overwrite a newer
manual refresh.

### Prompt and resource discovery warnings

Prompts and resources are optional MCP capabilities, so a failure to list them
never marks an upstream disconnected — its tools keep working and the row keeps
reading **Connected**. That would otherwise make a broken capability look
identical to an absent one, so a genuine failure raises a warning instead:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `prompts_unavailable` | `prompts/list` failed or timed out. The server's prompts are missing from the catalog; its tools are unaffected. |
| `resources_unavailable` | `resources/list` failed or timed out, with the same consequences. |

An upstream that simply does not implement the capability replies `-32601`, and
that is treated as success — it produces no warning and no error. So seeing one
of these codes means discovery genuinely broke, not that the server has nothing
to offer. Reconnecting an upstream clears the capability's circuit breaker and
retries discovery.

The tool and resource require `lab:admin`. They are advertised only when the
active MCP route has a gateway manager, includes the `gateway` service, and
allows `gateway.list`; a protected gateway subset that omits any of those
prerequisites will not expose the app. Labby sends tool/resource list-changed
notifications when this catalog changes. Reconnect clients that cache their
initial catalog and do not honor those notifications. If the app is still
missing, compare the running `labby --version` and binary with the build that
introduced `gateway_status`; updating a source checkout does not replace an
already-running service binary.

### Settings MCP App

Admin-capable MCP Apps hosts receive a synthetic `settings` tool bound to
`ui://lab/settings/editor`. The responsive app reads Labby's canonical settings
schema and presents section-scoped controls for Code Mode, proxying, surfaces,
features, and other safe scalar settings. Read-only and advanced values remain
redacted; restart requirements and effective value sources stay visible.

The callbacks delegate to the existing `setup` service's `settings.schema`,
`settings.state`, `settings.config.update`, and `settings.env.update` actions.
The tool and resource require `lab:admin` and are omitted when the active route
does not expose `setup`. Writes retain the setup dispatcher's backup-first,
atomic-write, validation, and MRTR elicitation behavior. `config.update` and
`env.update` inherit the destructive policy of their canonical `setup` actions;
the app does not send a payload-level confirmation flag or bypass the host's
native confirmation UI.

`code_mode.result_shape_policy` defaults to `"off"`. When set to `"truncate"`,
Labby shapes only successful completed final `result` values after the `__ui`
unwrap and before envelope truncation. Sandbox-visible `callTool()` and
`codemode.<upstream>.<tool>()` results are unchanged, `calls[]` remains
metadata-only, and MCP text JSON plus `structuredContent` are built from the
same shaped response. This does not retain the raw result for audit; use
`writeArtifact()` for large detailed payloads. The truncate policy is an output
bound, not redaction, and must not be used to sanitize secrets.

Code Mode execution handles upstream MCP tools only. Lab actions are not callable
from inside the Code Mode sandbox. Upstream ids use
`<upstream-name>::<tool-name>`.

Advertised tools per active mode:

| Mode | Advertised MCP tools |
|------|---------------------|
| `[code_mode].enabled = true` | `codemode`, optional `codemode_ui`; root peers also receive `mcp_app`, plus eligible enabled admin app tools |
| Neither | raw Lab service tools + healthy upstream tools; root peers also receive `mcp_app`, plus eligible enabled admin app tools |

Use `codemode` for gateway Code Mode. Discovery happens inside the sandbox with
`codemode.search()` and `codemode.describe()`.

Rules:

- `code_mode.timeout_ms` is validated in the range `1..=60000`
- `code_mode.result_shape_policy` accepts `"off"` or `"truncate"`
- `code_mode.max_response_bytes` is validated in the range `1024..=1048576`
- `code_mode.max_response_tokens` is validated in the range `256..=256000`
- `code_mode.token_estimate_divisor` is validated in the range `1..=64`
- `code_mode.max_log_entries` is validated in the range `1..=100000`
- `code_mode.max_log_bytes` is validated in the range `1..=104857600`
- `codemode` requires a non-empty `code` string
- `codemode` requires `lab` or `lab:admin` and broker calls through the gateway visibility checks
- Lab actions are not supported inside Code Mode `callTool`
- gateway action provenance fields (`origin` and `owner`) are reserved in Code Mode and are overwritten by the broker
- `codemode` enforces `timeout_ms` by killing the child process; tool calls are bounded by the run deadline and host-side tool policy, not by a per-run call-count cap
- invalid Code Mode ids return `invalid_code_mode_id`
- unavailable or overlarge upstream schemas may be omitted; generated signatures fall back to `unknown`
- old `[[upstream]].code_mode` blocks are accepted only as migration input and are dropped on the next gateway config write
- `gateway.update` rejects `patch.code_mode`; use `gateway.code_mode.set` instead

Tool-search observability:

- root MCP `list_tools` logs include `visibility_mode`, `hide_raw_tools`,
  `manager_code_mode_enabled`, `process_code_mode_enabled`,
  `suppressed_builtin_tool_count`, the returned `page_tool_count`, and
  `has_next_cursor`
- in-process Lab service peer discovery logs `in_process.list_tools.start` and
  `in_process.list_tools.finish` with `process_code_mode_enabled` and
  `tool_count`; when root code mode is enabled, built-in peers should report
  `tool_count=0`
- process-wide enablement changes log `code_mode.process_enablement` with
  `previous_enabled` and `enabled`

## Validation

- exactly one of `url` or `command` must be set
- `url` must use `http://` or `https://`
- bind-all addresses (`0.0.0.0`, `::`) are rejected
- RFC1918 and other private-network URLs are allowed
- stdio gateways are allowed. Proposed or persisted enabled stdio specs can
  execute local commands during `gateway.test`, `gateway.add`, and
  `gateway.update`; these paths require admin scope but are not marked
  destructive under Lab's permanent-data-loss definition.

`gateway.oauth.probe` is intentionally stricter than general gateway URL
validation: its `url` must use HTTPS and must not contain userinfo, a query, or
a fragment. Loopback HTTP remains supported by the shared OAuth client for
native development flows, but is not accepted by the remote probe action.

## Reconcile Model

Every mutating action follows the same sequence:

1. read and validate config
2. write `~/.config/labby/config.toml` with temp-file-in-same-dir plus rename
3. build and lazy-seed a fresh upstream pool outside the config mutation lock
4. atomically swap the runtime handle
5. leave Code Mode catalog refresh to the next `codemode` call, which
   reprobes live upstream metadata through the gateway manager
6. notify connected MCP peers when visible tool/resource/prompt catalogs changed

Reload does not live-connect every configured upstream. It records enabled
upstream names in the new shared pool and defers live discovery until a search,
exact tool execution, Code Mode call, or explicit gateway test needs one. Code
Mode search has no durable vector or lexical index to reindex; a stale search
catalog with successful direct execute is catalog freshness/session drift, not
upstream callability failure.

Observability requirements for that reconcile:

- log intent before config mutation begins
- log each phase transition (`config_write`, `pool_build`, `swap`, `notify`)
- log outcome with success/failure and elapsed time
- redact credential-bearing URLs, commands, args, and token-derived values in
  both logs and returned management views

## CLI Vs. Live Daemon

The reconcile model above describes what happens *inside one process*. The
CLI and the running `labby serve` daemon are separate processes, each with
their own in-memory `GatewayManager` -- a `labby gateway add` invocation
that builds its own throwaway manager would write `config.toml` correctly
but leave an already-running daemon (and the WebUI/MCP clients it serves)
unaware of the change until restarted or sent `SIGUSR1`.

To avoid that divergence, `labby gateway <subcommand>` first resolves an
explicit client target (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_SERVER_URL`, then
`LABBY_SERVER_URL`) or probes opportunistically (local bind address, then
`LABBY_MCP_GATEWAY_URL`/`LABBY_PUBLIC_URL`). If one responds, it dispatches
through the daemon's real HTTP API
(`POST /v1/gateway`, or the `codemode` MCP tool for `gateway code exec`) --
the same path the WebUI itself uses, since the WebUI is served *by* the live
daemon and shares its manager directly. Explicit targets remain authoritative
through dispatch, response decoding, Code Mode, and stdio MCP initialization;
failures are returned and local fallback is suppressed. Only bounded
opportunistic discovery may fall back to local `config.toml`, which keeps
bootstrap flows working standalone.

Running the CLI from a different machine than the daemon should use
`LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` and `LABBY_SERVER_URL`; see `docs/runtime/ENV.md` §
"Remote Gateway CLI Usage" for the exact precedence and fallback behavior.

The local `GatewayManager` these CLI commands fall back to is built lazily --
only if remote detection genuinely fails -- so a successful remote dispatch
never touches `~/.labby/auth.db` or any other local state at all
(`crate::cli::gateway::LazyGatewayManager`).

### The stdio MCP surface follows the same principle

`labby` is meant to have exactly one canonical, long-running gateway --
`labby serve` (HTTP transport). Every other surface, including `labby serve
--transport stdio` (a.k.a. `labby mcp`), should be a thin client to it
whenever one is reachable, not a second independent instance with its own
config view, upstream connections, and OAuth state.

Concretely: before building any local `GatewayManager` or upstream pool,
stdio startup calls `crate::live_gateway::detect()` -- the exact same
detection logic the CLI uses above, shared via `crate::live_gateway` (moved
there specifically so both surfaces could use it). If a live daemon answers,
the stdio process runs as a pure `crate::mcp::bridge::BridgeServerHandler`:
every `tools/`, `resources/`, and `prompts/` request received over stdio is
forwarded to the live daemon's own MCP endpoint via a streamable-HTTP
`Peer<RoleClient>`, and the response is piped straight back -- this process
holds no gateway state of its own. Only when bounded opportunistic discovery
returns no daemon does it fall back to a full standalone instance. Invalid or
unreachable explicit targets fail closed instead.

## Examples

### CLI

```bash
labby gateway list
labby gateway get remote-lab
labby gateway test --name remote-lab
labby gateway add --name remote-lab --url https://lab2.example.com/mcp --bearer-token-env LABBY_UPSTREAM_TOKEN
labby gateway add --name deepwiki --url https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp
labby gateway add --name local-tools --command local-mcp-server
labby gateway update remote-lab --proxy-resources true
labby gateway update remote-lab --command local-mcp-server --arg=--stdio
labby gateway update local-tools --url https://lab2.example.com/mcp
labby gateway update remote-lab --clear-bearer-token-env
labby gateway remove remote-lab
labby gateway reload
```

### MCP

```json
{ "tool": "gateway", "input": { "action": "gateway.list", "params": {} } }
{ "tool": "gateway", "input": { "action": "gateway.add", "params": { "spec": { "name": "remote-lab", "url": "https://lab2.example.com/mcp", "bearer_token_env": "LABBY_UPSTREAM_TOKEN" } } } }
{ "tool": "gateway", "input": { "action": "gateway.add", "params": { "spec": { "name": "deepwiki", "url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp" } } } }
{ "tool": "gateway", "input": { "action": "gateway.add", "params": { "spec": { "name": "local-tools", "command": "local-mcp-server" } } } }
{ "tool": "gateway", "input": { "action": "gateway.reload", "params": {} } }
```

For public streamable HTTP upstreams that require no upstream auth, omit
`bearer_token_env` and `oauth`. DeepWiki's deprecated `/sse` endpoint returns
HTTP 410; use `https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp`.

### HTTP API

```json
POST /v1/gateway
{ "action": "gateway.list", "params": {} }
```

```json
POST /v1/gateway
{ "action": "gateway.update", "params": { "name": "remote-lab", "patch": { "proxy_resources": true } } }
```

To switch transports over HTTP/MCP, set the new transport field and explicitly
clear the old one with `null`:

```json
{ "action": "gateway.update", "params": { "name": "remote-lab", "patch": { "command": "local-mcp-server", "args": ["--stdio"], "url": null } } }
{ "action": "gateway.update", "params": { "name": "local-tools", "patch": { "url": "https://lab2.example.com/mcp", "command": null, "args": [] } } }
```

## Gateway-Managed Protected MCP Routes

Gateway-managed protected MCP routes let Lab publish an arbitrary MCP backend at
a public host/path while Lab owns the OAuth protected-resource metadata,
challenge, token validation, and public error contract. The edge proxy points
the public MCP URL at Lab; Lab then proxies accepted Streamable HTTP MCP traffic
either to a raw backend MCP endpoint URL or to an existing named Gateway
upstream.

Use this for inline MCP services that should look like their own public OAuth
protected resources instead of appearing only as tools merged into Lab's `/mcp`
catalog.

Example public route:

```text
https://mcp.example.com/syslog
```

Example backend target:

```text
http://node.internal.example:3100/mcp
```

Persisted config lives in `[[protected_mcp_routes]]` entries in
`~/.config/labby/config.toml`:

```toml
[[protected_mcp_routes]]
name = "syslog"
enabled = true
public_host = "mcp.example.com"
public_path = "/syslog"
backend_url = "http://node.internal.example:3100/mcp"
scopes = ["mcp:read", "mcp:write"]
health_path = "/health"
```

Protected routes can also publish an existing named Gateway upstream instead of
proxying directly to a raw backend URL:

```toml
[[protected_mcp_routes]]
name = "axon"
enabled = true
public_host = "mcp.example.com"
public_path = "/axon"
upstream = "axon"
scopes = ["mcp:read", "mcp:write"]
```

When `upstream` is set, the protected route does not need `backend_url`. Lab
resolves the target URL and auth mode from the named `[[upstream]]` entry. For
OAuth upstreams, Lab uses the upstream OAuth credential stored for the shared
Gateway subject `gateway`.

On the first `tools/list` for a protected route, Labby resolves the route's
finite allowlist of enabled, non-OAuth upstreams before building the raw tool
contract. This prevents a cold protected route from advertising an empty
catalog while keeping the root route cache-only. Discovery is bounded by the
configured upstream request timeout and discovery concurrency; individual
upstream failures are logged and do not discard tools from healthy peers.

Stdio upstreams normally use a dedicated connection when downstream client
capabilities must be relayed. A singleton upstream that cannot safely spawn a
second process may set `MCP_UPSTREAM_RELAY_MODE=pooled` in its `[[upstream]].env`
table. That opt-out reuses the ordinary pooled connection, so the operator is
responsible for ensuring the upstream does not require the downstream
capabilities in its initial handshake.

Fields:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | Stable operator-facing route id. |
| `enabled` | Whether the route participates in metadata, challenge, auth, and proxy resolution. Defaults to `true`. |
| `public_host` | Bare public host only. Do not include scheme, port, or path. |
| `public_path` | Public MCP path prefix. Must include a service segment and cannot use Lab-reserved paths like `/.well-known/*` or `/v1/*`. |
| `upstream` | Optional named Gateway upstream to publish at this path. If the upstream uses OAuth, Lab uses the shared Gateway upstream OAuth credential when proxying. Mutually exclusive with `backend_url`; when set, `backend_url` is intentionally empty. |
| `backend_url` | Full backend Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint URL, for example `http://node.internal.example:3100/mcp`. Origin-only URLs are accepted as legacy input and default to `/mcp`. Mutually exclusive with `upstream`. |
| `backend_mcp_path` | Deprecated compatibility field for older configs. New routes should put the path in `backend_url`. |
| `scopes` | OAuth scopes advertised and enforced for this route. Defaults to `mcp:read` and `mcp:write`. |
| `health_path` | Optional backend health path used by route test actions. |
| `target.project_id` | Optional access-control Project binding for a `gateway_subset` target. It supplies project authorization context and is not valid for raw-backend or named-upstream routes. |

Management actions:

```json
{ "action": "gateway.protected_route.list", "params": {} }

CLI equivalents:

```bash
labby gateway protected-route list
labby gateway protected-route get syslog
labby gateway protected-route test \
  --name syslog \
  --public-host mcp.example.com \
  --public-path /syslog \
  --backend-url http://node.internal.example:3100/mcp
labby gateway protected-route test \
  --name axon \
  --public-host mcp.example.com \
  --public-path /axon \
  --upstream axon
labby gateway protected-route add \
  --name syslog \
  --public-host mcp.example.com \
  --public-path /syslog \
  --backend-url http://node.internal.example:3100/mcp \
  --scope mcp:read \
  --scope mcp:write
labby gateway protected-route add \
  --name axon \
  --public-host mcp.example.com \
  --public-path /axon \
  --upstream axon \
  --scope mcp:read \
  --scope mcp:write
labby gateway protected-route test \
  --name project-ops \
  --public-host mcp.example.com \
  --public-path /project-ops \
  --gateway-subset \
  --project-id project-42 \
  --loadout operations
labby gateway protected-route add \
  --name project-ops \
  --public-host mcp.example.com \
  --public-path /project-ops \
  --gateway-subset \
  --project-id project-42 \
  --loadout operations \
  --stage-for-restart
labby gateway protected-route update syslog \
  --public-host mcp.example.com \
  --public-path /syslog \
  --backend-url http://node.internal.example:3100/mcp \
  --enabled false
labby gateway protected-route remove syslog
```

For a gateway-subset update, omitting `--project-id` preserves the existing
Project binding. Use `--project-id <id>` to replace it or
`--clear-project-id` to remove it explicitly; an ordinary update never silently
unbinds the route. Project-bound gateway subsets are staged for restart under
the same rules as other gateway-subset routes.

Route testing has two layers:

- `labby gateway protected-route test ...` validates the route config and
  backend health path before saving or updating the Lab config.
- `just protected-mcp-smoke -- --app-url https://lab.example.com --mcp-url
  https://mcp.example.com --route /syslog` verifies the deployed public flow:
  Lab app health, route-specific protected-resource metadata, and the
  unauthenticated OAuth bearer challenge through the reverse proxy.

The Gateway UI exposes the same split: **Test** validates the Lab route config,
and **Smoke** runs the public proxy check using the current browser origin as
the Lab app URL and the route's public host/path as the MCP URL.

Operational timeout:

- `LABBY_PROTECTED_MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS` controls the connect timeout for
  Lab's protected MCP upstream proxy HTTP client. The default is `10` seconds.
  Set this higher only when upstream TCP/TLS connection setup is expected to be
  slow; long-lived MCP streams are not bounded by this connect timeout.

### Migration From Legacy Env Routes

Older inline MCP proxy experiments used service-specific env vars such as
`MCP_<SERVICE>_URLS` or `MCP_<SERVICE>_BACKEND`. Move those values into a
Gateway-managed route instead:

| Legacy value | New Gateway field |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Service name in `MCP_<SERVICE>_*` | `name` |
| Public host from the URL clients used | `public_host` |
| Public path from the URL clients used | `public_path` |
| Backend origin from `MCP_<SERVICE>_BACKEND` | `backend_url` |
| Backend MCP endpoint from `MCP_<SERVICE>_BACKEND` | `backend_url` |
| Required OAuth scope policy | `scopes` |

For example, replace:

```bash
MCP_SYSLOG_URLS=https://mcp.example.com/syslog
MCP_SYSLOG_BACKEND=http://node.internal.example:3100/mcp
```

with:

```bash
labby gateway protected-route add \
  --name syslog \
  --public-host mcp.example.com \
  --public-path /syslog \
  --backend-url http://node.internal.example:3100/mcp
```

The same fields are exposed in the Lab Gateway UI. Prefer the UI/CLI fields over
ad hoc env parsing so route validation, duplicate detection, OAuth metadata,
and public error redaction all use the same source of truth.

### Edge Proxy Requirements

The edge proxy must preserve the request authority and scheme Lab uses to match
the configured public resource:

- preserve `Host`
- set `X-Forwarded-Proto` to the original client scheme
- forward `Authorization`, `Accept`, `Content-Type`, `Mcp-Protocol-Version`,
  and every SEP-2243 `Mcp-*` routing header
- disable request/response buffering for the MCP proxy path
- avoid response compression on the MCP proxy path
- use long read/write/idle timeouts suitable for Streamable HTTP and SSE
- do not rewrite the public path before Lab sees it

Public route OAuth is not the same as Lab's static bearer compatibility path.
`Authorization: Bearer $LABBY_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` remains an operator/admin shortcut
for Lab's admin/API routes, but public Gateway-managed MCP routes validate Lab
OAuth JWTs for the route resource, for example
`https://mcp.example.com/syslog`. Do not use the static bearer token as the
public MCP client credential for these routes.

Public errors must not leak backend origins, backend paths, private IPs, token
env var names, or upstream transport errors. Unknown, disabled, unhealthy, and
auth-failed routes should return stable public errors that identify only the
public route and public error kind.

### SWAG / nginx

For SWAG or plain nginx, route the MCP host/path to Lab and keep streaming
behavior unbuffered:

```nginx
location /syslog {
    proxy_pass http://labby:8765;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
    proxy_set_header Accept $http_accept;
    proxy_set_header Content-Type $content_type;

    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_request_buffering off;
    gzip off;
    proxy_read_timeout 1h;
    proxy_send_timeout 1h;
}

location /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/syslog {
    proxy_pass http://labby:8765;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

If your SWAG include stack has a shared OAuth discovery location, make sure it
does not swallow path-suffixed metadata such as
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/syslog`. Those requests must reach Lab.

### Traefik

With Traefik, match both the public MCP path and the route-specific protected
resource metadata path, and forward to the Lab service:

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    syslog-mcp:
      rule: Host(`mcp.example.com`) && (PathPrefix(`/syslog`) || PathPrefix(`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/syslog`))
      entryPoints: [websecure]
      service: labby
      tls: {}
  services:
    labby:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://labby:8765
        passHostHeader: true
```

Do not attach compression or buffering middleware to this router. Set transport
timeouts high enough for long-lived SSE reads.

### Generic Tunnels

For Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale Funnel, Pangolin, or another generic tunnel,
publish the public host to Lab's HTTP listener and keep the path intact. The
tunnel or local reverse proxy in front of Lab must pass the original `Host` and
scheme-equivalent `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers. Avoid tunnel features that buffer
large request bodies, compress event streams, or enforce short idle timeouts on
SSE connections.

### Verification Checklist

Set:

```bash
BASE=https://mcp.example.com
ROUTE=/syslog
TOKEN=<lab-oauth-access-token-for-this-resource>
```

Metadata is public and route-specific:

```bash
curl -i "$BASE/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource$ROUTE"
```

Expected:

- `200`
- JSON `resource` is `https://mcp.example.com/syslog`
- `authorization_servers` points at the Lab issuer/public URL
- `scopes_supported` includes the route scopes
- no backend URL appears in headers or body

Unauthenticated MCP request returns a challenge:

```bash
curl -i -X POST "$BASE$ROUTE" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Mcp-Protocol-Version: 2026-07-28' \
  -H 'Mcp-Method: server/discover' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"server/discover","params":{"_meta":{"io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion":"2026-07-28","io.modelcontextprotocol/clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"0"},"io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities":{}}}}'
```

Expected:

- `401`
- `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/syslog"`
- structured public auth error
- no backend URL appears in headers or body

OAuth resource flow:

```bash
curl -i "$BASE/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource$ROUTE"
```

Use the advertised authorization server to request a token for resource
`https://mcp.example.com/syslog` and the configured scopes. The resulting access
token must be presented to the public route, not to the backend.

If the protected route publishes a named upstream that also uses OAuth, Lab
performs a second, separate auth step behind the route: it uses the upstream
OAuth credential stored for the shared Gateway subject when proxying to the
private upstream MCP server. The public Lab token is never passed through to the
upstream authorization server.

Stateless server discovery:

```bash
curl -i -X POST "$BASE$ROUTE" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -H 'Mcp-Protocol-Version: 2026-07-28' \
  -H 'Mcp-Method: server/discover' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"server/discover","params":{"_meta":{"io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion":"2026-07-28","io.modelcontextprotocol/clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"0"},"io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities":{}}}}'
```

Expected:

- success response advertises `2026-07-28` as the primary stateless protocol
  and declares the SDK-known historical versions that the legacy
  `initialize` compatibility path genuinely adapts
- no `Mcp-Session-Id` response header
- no public response reveals `backend_url`

Stateless tools list:

```bash
curl -i -X POST "$BASE$ROUTE" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -H 'Mcp-Protocol-Version: 2026-07-28' \
  -H 'Mcp-Method: tools/list' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{"_meta":{"io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion":"2026-07-28","io.modelcontextprotocol/clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"0"},"io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities":{}}}}'
```

Expected:

- `200` with a valid `tools/list` result
- no `Mcp-Session-Id` response header
- no backend URL appears in headers or body

Notification subscription:

```bash
curl -i -N -X POST "$BASE$ROUTE" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' \
  -H 'Mcp-Protocol-Version: 2026-07-28' \
  -H 'Mcp-Method: subscriptions/listen' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"subscriptions/listen","params":{"notifications":{"toolsListChanged":true,"resourcesListChanged":true,"promptsListChanged":true},"_meta":{"io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion":"2026-07-28","io.modelcontextprotocol/clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"0"},"io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities":{}}}}'
```

Expected:

- the stream acknowledges the accepted notification filter
- later catalog changes carry the subscription request ID in notification
  metadata
- cancelling the request ends the subscription; no session-delete request is
  required

Disabled and unknown route behavior:

```bash
curl -i "$BASE/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/disabled"
curl -i -X POST "$BASE/disabled" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{}'
curl -i "$BASE/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/not-a-route"
curl -i -X POST "$BASE/not-a-route" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{}'
```

Expected:

- disabled routes do not advertise protected-resource metadata and do not proxy
  to the backend
- unknown routes do not advertise metadata and do not proxy to any backend
- public errors are stable and redacted; they must not reveal backend origins,
  backend paths, private IPs, or configured token env var names

## Upstream OAuth Routes

For upstreams configured with `[upstream.oauth]` (see
[CONFIG.md](../runtime/CONFIG.md#upstream-oauth-authorization_code--pkce) and
[UPSTREAM.md](./UPSTREAM.md#upstream-oauth-authorization_code--pkce)), the
hosted HTTP gateway mounts four master-only HTTP routes. All four require an authenticated
session and the master-only middleware; non-master sessions get `403`.

The `labby mcp` stdio surface uses the same managers and encrypted credential
store without requiring the hosted HTTP server. It starts a loopback-only
callback listener on `127.0.0.1`, opens the browser lazily on the first
reauthorization, and retries the waiting upstream connection after the callback.
Set `LABBY_OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and, if a provider requires a stable registered
port, `LABBY_STDIO_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT`; otherwise Labby asks the OS for an
ephemeral port. Stdio OAuth always uses the trusted shared subject `gateway`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/v1/gateway/oauth/start` | Begin authorization for the shared gateway subject `gateway`. Body `{ "upstream": "<name>" }`. Returns `{ "authorization_url": "..." }` (JSON only — no browser-redirect mode). |
| `GET` | `/auth/upstream/callback` | Authorization-code callback. Validates the authenticated session, atomically takes the pending state row (bound to `(upstream, subject)`), exchanges the code, persists encrypted credentials, redirects to `/gateway/oauth/result?upstream=<name>&status=<ok\|fail>`. |
| `GET` | `/v1/gateway/oauth/status?upstream=<name>` | Returns `{ "authenticated": bool, "upstream": "<name>", "expires_within_5m": bool }`. Deliberately omits subject and raw expiry timestamp to avoid enumeration and fingerprinting. |
| `POST` | `/v1/gateway/oauth/clear?upstream=<name>` | Requires `upstream` (the upstream name). Deletes persisted credentials and evicts the cached `AuthClient`. In-flight requests complete naturally under the old credential (graceful drain by Rust ownership — not a designed protocol). |

### OAuth Operator Examples

CLI:

```bash
labby gateway mcp auth start chrome-devtools
labby gateway mcp auth open chrome-devtools --wait
labby gateway mcp auth status chrome-devtools
labby gateway mcp auth clear chrome-devtools
```

MCP tool calls:

```json
{ "tool": "gateway", "input": { "action": "gateway.oauth.start", "params": { "upstream": "chrome-devtools" } } }
{ "tool": "gateway", "input": { "action": "gateway.oauth.status", "params": { "upstream": "chrome-devtools" } } }
{ "tool": "gateway", "input": { "action": "gateway.oauth.clear", "params": { "upstream": "chrome-devtools" } } }
```

These actions now operate on the shared gateway OAuth subject `gateway`, so the
web UI, CLI, and MCP tool surface all refer to the same stored upstream
credential row.

When an OAuth upstream is also published through a protected MCP route with
`upstream = "<name>"`, successful upstream authorization is required before the
route can proxy MCP traffic. `gateway.test` and the Gateway UI capability
checks use the same shared subject and should report discovered tools/resources
after authorization.

Callback security invariants (enforced in code, spec-required):

- The callback is a browser-facing redirect endpoint. Subject is resolved from
  the authenticated browser session cookie, **not** from the `state` parameter
  or the pending state row. No session → `oauth_state_invalid`.
- The `upstream` query parameter is forwarded to the manager, which enforces it
  against the pending state row's upstream name via the SQL primary key
  (`(upstream_name, subject, csrf_token)`).
- `state` is matched via a single `DELETE ... RETURNING` to prevent replay
  across connection-pool races.
- The result page HTML-escapes the operator-controlled `upstream` name.

### Reload And Credential Lifecycle

- `gateway.reload` eagerly evicts all cached `AuthClient` entries for every
  OAuth upstream in the current config, then rebuilds a fresh upstream pool.
  OAuth upstreams are rediscovered with the shared `gateway` subject when the
  upstream OAuth runtime is configured.
  It does **not** delete persisted credential rows — `AuthClient`s are rebuilt
  on the next request using whatever credentials are in the store.
- `clear_credentials` is the only way to invalidate a persisted credential.
  It evicts the cache entry and deletes the row; in-flight `Arc<AuthClient>`
  holders complete naturally under the old token.
- Expired access-only credential rows (no refresh token) are pruned by the
  60-second `cleanup_expired` background task, alongside expired PKCE state.

## Inbound Clients

`gateway.clients.list` reports MCP clients/agents currently connected to this
gateway's own `/mcp` endpoint — the inbound side, distinct from everything
else in this document, which covers the outbound upstream proxy.

Each entry (`GatewayClientView`) carries a redacted actor display tag (never
the raw authenticated subject — see [OBSERVABILITY.md](../dev/OBSERVABILITY.md)
for the `actor_key` redaction convention this reuses), the client's
self-declared MCP client name/version from `server/discover` request metadata,
the transport (`stdio`, `http`, `in-process`, or `test`), and a connect
timestamp.

```json
{ "action": "gateway.clients.list", "params": {} }
```

Two things this is explicitly **not**:

- **Not a live liveness view.** Entries are observations appended on
  `server/discover`, not durable connections. Stateless requests carry their
  own client metadata, while live catalog notifications use explicit
  `subscriptions/listen` streams that are removed when cancelled.
- **Not authenticated identity.** `client_name`/`client_version` are
  self-declared by the peer during the MCP handshake and are not verified —
  treat them as a display label, not an identity claim. The redacted subject
  tag is the only field backed by actual auth state.

The registry is bounded (drop-oldest past a fixed entry cap) and truncates
every peer-controlled string field before storage, since a client is
untrusted input from the gateway's perspective — a reconnecting or hostile
peer must not be able to grow this list, or any one field in it, unbounded.

## Limitations

- `gateway.reload` is the only action that promises to pick up changed bearer-token env vars.
- The product HTTP API exposes `/v1/gateway` for gateway management, but it still does not proxy arbitrary upstream MCP tools through `/v1/*`.
- Runtime counts depend on current discovery state; an unreachable upstream can remain configured while reporting zero discovered items.
- Gateway mutations rewrite `config.toml` by serializing the full `LabConfig` struct. TOML comments and unknown keys not represented in the struct are dropped on write. A migration to `toml_edit` for comment-preserving round-trips is deferred.
